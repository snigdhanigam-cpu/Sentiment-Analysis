The region is known for its dense sal forests and fertile fields, but after years of neglect it’s one of the country’s poorest areas.

Nepal is one of the youngest countries in South Asia, with a median age of 25.3 years (the US median age is 39.1). High fertility rates in previous decades have created a “youth bulge”—the largest in the region’s history. But many young people like Bam see no future in their homeland. The country has effectively outsourced its labor market to Malaysia, South Korea, and the Gulf states, exporting its youth instead of creating opportunities at home. Minimum wages are not enough to sustain a life within Nepal’s borders, leaving young Nepalis with a stark choice: Leave to study abroad, or leave to work abroad.

Those who stay are forced to contend with a political system that doesn’t work for them. Even with steep taxes, essential services are in disarray. In the 1950s, the first democratic movement brought free elections, before the monarchy reasserted control. In the 1990s, citizens rose again and reclaimed democracy, but poor governance, civil war, and the 2005 royal coup, when King Gyanendra dismissed parliament, arrested political leaders, and imposed a media blackout, snuffed out that hope. Even after the fall of the monarchy and the end of the war, the structural problems that had driven Nepal’s unrest persisted. The Maoists, who had launched a decade-long “People’s War” in 1996 demanding the creation of a republic that would address deep inequalities, especially in rural Nepal, were subsumed into mainstream politics. Their movement, once rooted in the frustrations of marginalized groups like Dalits, Indigenous communities, and poor farmers shut out of Kathmandu’s elite, helped establish Nepal as a federal democratic republic. But over time, the Maoists became part of the same establishment they had once fought to dismantle. Power continued to circulate among a familiar set of parties and leaders.

For Bam and her peers, the online world offered a place to express outrage, build solidarity, and speak freely. She started posting about corruption and inequality on social media, sharing photos of herself at small rallies, holding a megaphone or a hand-drawn pamphlet. Then, in early September 2025, a new trend started to sweep across Nepali social media.",https://www.wired.com/story/nepal-discord-gen-z-protests-vote-prime-minister-election/#main-content,2025-11-04 11:00:00+00:00,"Rakshya Bam grew up in Kailali, a lowland district in Nepal’s far west, where the subtropical plains stretch toward the Indian border.

On Monday, some protesters forced their way into the Parliament complex in the capital, Kathmandu, by breaking through a barricade, a local official said.

One protester told the ANI news agency that the police had been firing “indiscriminately”.

“[They] fired bullets which missed me but hit a friend who was standing behind me. He was hit in the hand,” the protester said.

Seven people died at the National Trauma Centre, chief medical superintendent Dr Badri Rijal told The Associated Press news agency.

“Many of them are in serious condition and appear to have been shot in the head and chest,” Rijal said.

Families waited anxiously outside for news of their relatives while people gathered to donate blood.

Police officer Shekhar Khanal told Reuters that more than 100 people, including 28 police personnel, were receiving medical treatment for their injuries. Two people were killed when protests in the eastern city of Itahari turned violent, police said.

The United Nations has called for accountability following the bloodshed. “We are shocked by the killings and injury of protesters in Nepal today and urge a prompt and transparent investigation,” UN rights office spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said in a statement.

Anurag Acharya, director at the Kathmandu-based think tank Policy Entrepreneurs Inc, says the trigger for the protests may have been the social media ban, but the underlying reasons go much deeper.

“This is the generation that grew up with the optimism and dream of an inclusive new Nepal, a dream that remains elusive a decade after the new constitution was promulgated,” he said.

“The reality for today’s Gen Z is that there are few livelihood prospects at home, which forces thousands to migrate abroad for studies and jobs. So, the frustration with unstable governments and rampant corruption had reached a tipping point,” Acharya told Al Jazeera, referring to the frequent change in governments since the monarchy was abolished in 2008, after 10 years of the Maoist rebellion.

‘Youths against corruption’

Thousands of young people, including students in their school and college uniforms, joined the protest, holding signs that read “Shut down corruption and not social media”, “Unban social media”, and “Youths against corruption”, as they marched through Kathmandu.

Ikshama Tumrok, a 20-year-old student, told the AFP news agency that she was protesting against the “authoritarian attitude” of the government.

“We want to see change. Others have endured this, but it has to end with our generation,” she said.

Last week, the government decided to block access to several social media platforms, including Facebook, YouTube and X, fuelling anger among young Nepalis.

According to officials, the decision was taken because platforms had failed to register with authorities in a crackdown on misuse, including fake social media accounts used to spread hate speech and fake news and commit fraud.

Organisers of the protests, which have been dubbed “demonstrations by Gen Z”, have said their civil disobedience reflects how the youth feel about the government decision.

One protester told ANI that this was “the protest by the new generation in Nepal”.

Muktiram Rijal, a spokesperson for the Kathmandu District Administration Office, told the Reuters news agency that the police had orders to use water cannon, batons and rubber bullets to control the crowd and that the army had been deployed.

According to Rijal, the curfew, which will remain in place until 10pm (16:15 GMT), has been extended to Kathmandu’s Singha Durbar area, which includes the prime minister’s office and other government buildings.

Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli called an emergency cabinet meeting in the wake of deadly protests.

On Sunday, the government said in a statement that it respected freedom of thought and expression and was committed to “creating an environment for their protection and unfettered use”.

Acharya, who is based in Kathmandu, slammed the government’s reaction to the protests.

“It treated unarmed school and college-going kids like a criminal mob and ordered police to fire indiscriminately at them. The poorly equipped and outnumbered police used live bullets rather than non-lethal riot control measures,” he said.

He didn’t even know there was a curfew. People in Nepal, largely driven by Gen Z youth, had taken to the streets, and that day riots broke out when nearly two dozen people were shot and killed by authorities. In the middle of it all was Jackson, a travel vlogger riding from Thailand to the United Kingdom on his bike.

Within a day, the mass demonstrations that filled the capital would do the seemingly impossible: defy trigger-happy law enforcement, storm the grounds of parliament and set fire to the building, and oust a prime minister.

https://www.wired.com/story/nepal-discord-gen-z-protests-vote-prime-minister-election/,"Coordinated fake social media accounts drove Nepal’s Gen Z protest, cyber intelligence finds","KATHMANDU, Oct 7: An Israel-based cyber intelligence firm has revealed that roughly one in every three social media users calling for Nepal’s September 8–9 Gen Z protests were fake accounts.

Cyabra, a company specializing in detecting online disinformation and social media inauthenticity, said these profiles blended seamlessly with real users, making it difficult to distinguish manipulated activity from authentic engagement. Its investigation found that fake accounts made up 34% of the sampled profiles on X (formerly Twitter). They amplified protest hashtags, reinforced anti-government narratives and strategically engaged with real users to expand their influence.

While genuine users drove the bulk of protest activity, the report highlights the disproportionate role of fake accounts in magnifying messages. Cyabra identified 1,288 inauthentic accounts on X, which, despite their smaller numbers, generated 11.5% of total engagements—over 164,000 interactions—and had a potential reach of 326 million views or 14% of the total.

“These findings demonstrate how coordinated inauthentic activity can significantly amplify the visibility and impact of protest narratives,” the report noted.

According to Cyabra, although the majority of participants were authentic voices demanding reform, one in three accounts engaging in protest-related discourse were either fake or part of a coordinated campaign. These accounts promoted extreme and confrontational content across platforms including X, Facebook and TikTok.

The protests began online under the hashtag #Nepokid, aimed at exposing the lavish lifestyles of politicians’ children and initially called for a peaceful demonstration on September 8. However, the government’s sudden ban on 26 social media apps sparked larger crowds, with thousands of young Nepalis posting messages against corruption and demanding accountability. Cyabra said coordinated fake accounts spread narratives reaching over 326 million potential viewers worldwide.

Online mobilization for the Gen Z protest, according to the report, began in early August, intensifying as the protests approached, with hashtags such as #GenZProtest, #WakeUpNepal, and #September8 gaining traction. Many posts used AI-generated visuals, while viral videos on TikTok and Facebook encouraged participation and reached audiences in the millions.

As demonstrations turned violent on September 8, online discourse shifted toward outrage, grief, and demands for accountability, circulating graphic images, testimonies and videos of clashes. The following day’s protests raised the death toll to 75, with more than 2,000 others injured, ultimately leading to Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli’s resignation.

Cyabra’s report found that fake accounts employed AI-generated visuals, hijacked popular protest hashtags, and interacted with authentic profiles to appear legitimate. The online conversation consistently framed young Nepalis as defenders of democracy, with narratives emphasizing a youth-led democratic struggle, allegations of police brutality and state repression, and a deepening political crisis.

The study concluded that Nepal’s Gen Z protests illustrate both the empowering and vulnerable aspects of social media. Digital platforms enabled youth mobilization, expression of grievances, and calls for systemic reform, but they also allowed manipulation by fake actors who amplified and reshaped protest messaging beyond organic audiences.

Dr. Rajib Subba, a cybersecurity researcher at Madan Bhandari University of Science and Technology, said such manipulation was a global phenomenon. “Cyberspace is increasingly being weaponized to pursue certain agendas. Countries, including Nepal, must remain vigilant to counter these threats,” he said.",https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/coordinated-fake-social-media-accounts-drove-nepals-gen-z-protest-cyber-int-49-87.html,,"KATHMANDU, Oct 7: An Israel-based cyber intelligence firm has revealed that roughly one in every three social media users calling for Nepal’s September 8–9 Gen Z protests were fake accounts.

Partial Enforcement of India’s Telecom Act: A Total Eclipse of Digital Rights

end-to-end encryption, so it ends up creating an overarching communications surveillance framework.

It’s a Shit Show,"A young, pregnant Venezuelan woman came to the US without documentation last year. After giving birth and settling in Ohio, she found that trying to stay in the country was too hard. She had no family support for herself and her newborn, and struggled to find work and housing. So she decided to self-deport.

The Trump administration has been virtually begging immigrants in the US to self-deport. It’s self-deportation, the White House says, or risk the wrath of ICE, the country’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.

But self-deportation has been nearly impossible for this woman and others like her, lawyers and immigration activists tell WIRED. Guidance from the US government for those who have decided to self-deport has been confusing and sparse, leaving many immigration attorneys and advocates in the dark. Some immigrants trying to leave the country voluntarily through government-endorsed mechanisms say they have found themselves in limbo or, worse, detained.

CBP Home, the app from Customs and Border Protection that’s supposed to help immigrants self-deport, is only somewhat helpful, and it launches some immigrants into a confusing and drawn-out bureaucratic process, says Jessica Ramos, an immigration attorney practicing in Ohio who represents the stranded woman. That, coupled with little help from the US government, has made getting out of the US “an odyssey,” Ramos claims.

Ramos’ client, who asked not to be named but gave permission for her story to be shared, does not have a Venezuelan passport or the money for a flight. She says she filled out her information on the CBP Home app, then received a notice that she would receive a call from the US government to help her arrange her departure. She says the call never came.

This isn’t what’s supposed to happen: In March, the Department of Homeland Security released CBP Home, which theoretically facilitates self-deportation, providing a form for undocumented immigrants to fill out. It also offers help booking tickets for those needing assistance, the waiving of fines, “cost-free travel,” and a $1,000 bonus. Those who use the app aren’t supposed to have criminal histories and are also meant to be “temporarily deprioritized” for detention and deportation. Initially, CBP Home was advertised as an all-in-one app that would help with everything from travel documents to financial assistance.

Immigration has become the centerpiece of the Trump administration’s policy agenda, and the White House has heavily encouraged immigrants in the US to leave of their own volition. On May 9, the White House announced Project Homecoming, claiming the government would provide assistance for immigrants seeking to leave. According to the presidential proclamation, Project Homecoming promises to facilitate “travel for those lacking valid travel documents, and offers a concierge service at airports to assist with booking travel.”These services, the project said, would eventually be backed with $250 million the government had previously utilized to support refugees. In a statement issued in October, DHS claimed that more than 1.6 million people have “voluntarily self-deported” in 2025.

Here’s What Its Operatives Are Doing Now,"To one member of Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, the last few months have been “crazy.” In a slideshow of photos and videos posted to Instagram last month, Yat Choi—who joined DOGE this spring—posted clips of Trump administration officials dancing on the White House lawn to“Y.M.C.A”; people loading into what appears to be a private jet; and house parties decorated with American flags and attendees donning red, white, and blue hats holding red Solo cups and cans of High Noon.

On Instagram, Choi described his work as ongoing, announcing that he was returning to the underground Pennsylvania mine where federal retirement claims are processed. “Like Jigga [Jay-Z] I showed them the blueprint back in April, now going back in the Mine to lead the pilots next week,” wrote Choi, who previously worked as an engineer at AirBnb and has referred to Canada as home in other Instagram posts. Choi did not respond to a request for comment.

It’s not just Choi. Many of the original young and inexperienced DOGE technologists whose identities were first reported by WIRED appear to still be enmeshed in federal agencies. Edward “Big Balls” Coristine, Gavin Kliger, Marko Elez, Akash Bobba, and Ethan Shaotran all still claim to be affiliated with DOGE or the US government. So do other tech workers from Silicon Valley and Musk companies like xAI and SpaceX. Coristine, Kliger, Elez, Bobba, and Shaotran did not respond to requests for comment.

The DOGE ethos—characterized by cutting contracts and government workers, consolidating data across agencies, and importing private sector practices—remains fully in force. While several media reports have suggested that DOGE has all but fizzled out, DOGE affiliates are scattered across the federal government working as developers, designers, and even leading agencies in powerful roles.

“That’s absolutely false,” one USDA source says of reporting that DOGE has disbanded. “They are in fact burrowed into the agencies like ticks.”

DOGE has “just transformed,” an IRS employee tells WIRED.

While DOGE is no longer moving across the government in a move-fast-and-break-things blitz, DOGE affiliates appear to be digging in for the long haul—and Silicon Valley–shaped fingerprints remain all over the way agencies continue to be run.

Over the last few weeks, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has rolled out coding tests to its hundreds of technical staff, quizzing them over their “technical proficiency.” The decision to roll out these tests came from Sam Corcos, a DOGE operative and chief information officer of the Treasury, according to a source familiar with the situation.

https://www.wired.com/story/nepal-discord-gen-z-protests-vote-prime-minister-election/,The Destruction of a Notorious Myanmar Scam Compound Appears to Have Been ‘Performative’,"After Myanmar’s military junta raided a notorious scam compound and destroyed buildings with explosives in October, officials claimed the country would entirely “eradicate” forced scamming within its borders. Now newly released satellite images of the targeted KK Park scam center reveal that only buildings in one limited section of the compound were destroyed during the initial raids. Experts on scam compounds, meanwhile, say the entire effort is likely “propaganda.”

High-resolution images of the KK Park scam compound, which is located near the Myanmar-Thailand border, show how military forces have razed multiple buildings, leaving piles of rubble in their place. However, the images show the destruction is, so-far, confined to the Eastern side of the gigantic compound—with hundreds of buildings across the vast compound being left untouched.

Multiple experts tell WIRED that the raids at KK Park and some other scam compounds are likely part of a wider “performative” effort by Myanmar's military government, which has come under increasing pressure to tackle the highly lucrative scam compounds that have flourished in recent years. They also raise concerns about the welfare of thousands of people forced to run scams in KK Park.

“The junta is making it sound as though they’re taking down the entire compound, and the imagery that we have seen so far is only limited to one section,” says Eric Heintz, a global analyst at the International Justice Mission, an anti-slavery organization. “It’s important to keep monitoring this to verify what they’re actually doing and [see] if this is just for show or if they’re actually cracking down on the real problem.”

The satellite images, taken on November 16, appear to show that some buildings located around courtyards have been almost totally destroyed, with debris strewn around other buildings. Heintz says that the images, plus extra social media footage, indicates that some “villas” and dormitories where trafficking victims may have been housed appear to have been damaged or destroyed. (Myanmar’s military government has said further destruction started on November 17; third-party reports also suggest more buildings have been destroyed).

“All of the critical buildings that you would need to perpetrate the scams are still intact and still ready for use,” says Mechelle B Moore, the CEO of anti-trafficking nonprofit Global Alms, which is based in Thailand and works to help people who have trafficked into scam compounds in Myanmar. “They’re putting on a good show right now to say that they don’t support scamming compounds or human trafficking. But what they’ve allowed is all the scamming syndicates—all of the scamming bosses and supervisors—have been allowed to flee,” Moore claims.

Over the past decade, dozens of scam compounds have appeared in Southeast Asia, primarily across Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos. Often operated by or linked to Chinese organized crime groups, the compounds trick people into working at them—often with the offer of high-paying jobs—and then force them to run a range of scams. Trafficking victims often have their passports taken; they can be tortured or beaten if they refuse to scam. By stealing from people around the world, the compounds have made billions for the organized crime groups.

Amid the extensive criminality, KK Park has emerged as one of the largest and most notorious scam compounds in Myanmar. Five years ago, the site was a series of fields near the town of Myawaddy, but has since been transformed into a sprawling compound with hundreds of buildings and thousands of people held there.",https://www.wired.com/story/myanmar-kk-park-scam-compound-destruction/#intcid=_wired-article-bottom-recirc_8ddfa393-7ef7-467d-8bf8-f46fcee3a0c2_roberta-similarity1,2025-11-26 16:33:45.573000+00:00,"After Myanmar’s military junta raided a notorious scam compound and destroyed buildings with explosives in October, officials claimed the country would entirely “eradicate” forced scamming within its borders.

https://www.wired.com/story/nepal-discord-gen-z-protests-vote-prime-minister-election/,A Complete Guide to the Jeffrey Epstein Document Dumps,"For the past few months, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has engaged in a sprawling and extremely public investigation of disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Keeping track of it all can be hard, even for the sharpest observers.

While initial public interest in what Epstein-related documents the federal government possesses has focused on investigative files held by the Department of Justice, the Oversight Committee’s inquiry expands far past that. In addition to subpoenaing the DOJ, the committee has sent letters or issued subpoenas to several other entities, including the US Treasury Department, the Attorney General of the US Virgin Islands, the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein, and multiple banks.

In some cases, those entities were instructed to send separate copies of the same documents to both Democrats and Republicans on the committee. Those lawmakers have released their own selections of documents to the public, sometimes on the same day and sometimes consisting of overlapping sets of pages.

These releases have varied in format, from screenshots of multiple emails stitched together into a single PDF file, to a Google Drive link containing a 30,000-page dump still in an e-discovery format.

Most recently, Democrats on the committee published over a dozen photos from a set of 95,000 produced by the estate. The photos showed Epstein with wealthy and powerful men, including presidents Donald Trump and Bill Clinton, as well as sex toys and a pile of condoms with illustrations of Trump on the packaging. The photos also included several women whose faces were redacted. In a press release, Democrats promised that they would eventually release additional photos.

In short, it’s kind of confusing to know what’s been released, what hasn’t, and what’s still expected to come. WIRED reviewed letters and subpoenas sent by the House Oversight Committee, as well as what’s been released so far to the public, to make clear what the many Epstein document releases entail and where the public can access them. And the Oversight Committee isn’t the only part of the government working to release additional documents—the DOJ was recently granted motions to unseal grand jury materials by three different federal judges, and is expected to release an additional dump of documents later this month to comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act.

Meanwhile, the Oversight Committee appears to be zeroing in on Epstein’s financial records–in public statements, it has said that both the banks and the Treasury are complying with its requests, but it has yet to release documents from them. WIRED identified three gaps in the committee’s releases from Epstein’s estate, which a committee aide confirmed and said included information about Epstein’s bank accounts and cash ledgers.

US Department of Justice

In early August, the committee subpoenaed Pam Bondi in her capacity as attorney general, requesting documents and communications related to the DOJ’s lawsuits against Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, the 2007 Florida investigation into Epstein, and Epstein’s death, among other things.

An initial 33,295 pages of “Epstein-related records” were produced to the committee and later released in September. At the time, committee Democrats claimed that “97 percent of the pages included information previously released” by various law enforcement agencies. The documents include surveillance footage the night Epstein was found dead in his jail cell, public court filings from the investigations mentioned in the subpoena’s requests for production, and a memo from Bondi to FBI director Kash Patel about releasing the Epstein files. (In other words, documents and communications related to the lawsuits.)

A press release from late November reiterated that the DOJ had produced “roughly 33,000 pages of records to date,” and the Oversight Committee had not released additional documents from the DOJ as of early December. Congress has since passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which will require the DOJ to publish all unclassified records related to the investigation and prosecution of Epstein “in a searchable and downloadable format” (much to the relief of those who plan on poring over what’s released.)

The US Treasury

In late August, US representative James Comer sent a letter to Treasury secretary Scott Bessent requesting Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) and “accompanying material” related to Epstein and Maxwell. SARs in particular are closely guarded, and unauthorized disclosure of them is a violation of federal law.

The letter requested documents no later than September 15, 2025. An Oversight Committee press release from late November said that “the Department of Treasury is fully cooperating with the committee’s request,” but so far no documents have been released to the public.",https://www.wired.com/story/a-complete-guide-to-the-jeffrey-epstein-document-dumps/#intcid=_wired-article-bottom-recirc_8ddfa393-7ef7-467d-8bf8-f46fcee3a0c2_roberta-similarity1,2025-12-10 15:26:18.999000+00:00,"For the past few months, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has engaged in a sprawling and extremely public investigation of disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Lurie’s team let me know ahead of time that his window for this conversation was tight: He’d just come from announcing a new city police chief, and had about half an hour for me before he needed to be on to the next thing. Which was? “No idea,” Lurie quipped, shortly before we were foisted from backstage and into our conversation in front of several hundred attendees—a local crowd, who, judging from their boisterous reactions to Lurie’s every word, are among the 73 percent of San Franciscans who approve of the job he’s done since taking office in January of this year.

To Lurie’s credit, the story of San Francisco right now is largely a positive one. The city is indisputably the global hub of AI innovation and the billions of dollars that accompany it, with companies like Anthropic and OpenAI, along with smaller startups, investors, and plenty of young, AI-focused technologists all calling San Francisco home. Yes, that means rents are up and housing stock remains precariously low. But office vacancy rates are dropping, retail outlets are coming back to the city’s downtown, and as Lurie’s office is quick to tout, several key metrics measuring municipal crime—including homicides and car break-ins—are at historic lows.

I wanted to talk to Lurie about all of that, but I was also curious about the bigger picture: his administration’s dynamic with the federal government, particularly in the context of President Trump’s October plan to send the National Guard into San Francisco—an endeavor that Lurie managed to thwart, according to The New York Times, by recruiting a powerful coterie of technology executives to work the phones in his favor.

Lurie wasn’t exactly forthcoming there, in keeping with his diligent efforts to focus conversations on San Francisco, and perhaps avoid attracting the attention, or the ire, of the current administration. It’s a different tack than other Democrats governing progressive parts of the country have taken, from New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani to California governor Gavin Newsom. But if the response in the room last week was any indication, Lurie’s local fans don’t seem to mind his “say less” strategy—at least for now.

This article was created in partnership with 404 Media, a journalist-owned publication covering how technology impacts humans. For more stories like this, sign up here.

The findings bring up questions about who exactly has access to footage collected by Flock surveillance cameras and where people reviewing the footage may be based. Flock has become a pervasive technology in the US, with its cameras present in thousands of communities that cops use every day to investigate things like carjackings. Local police have also performed numerous lookups for ICE in the system.

Companies that use AI or machine learning regularly turn to overseas workers to train their algorithms, often because the labor is cheaper than hiring domestically. But the nature of Flock’s business—creating a surveillance system that constantly monitors US residents’ movements—means that footage might be more sensitive than other AI training jobs.

Flock’s cameras continuously scan the license plate, color, brand, and model of all vehicles that drive by. Law enforcement are then able to search cameras nationwide to see where else a vehicle has driven. Authorities typically dig through this data without a warrant, leading the American Civil Liberties Union and Electronic Frontier Foundation to recently sue a city blanketed in nearly 500 Flock cameras.

Broadly, Flock uses AI or machine learning to automatically detect license plates, vehicles, and people, including what clothes they are wearing, from camera footage. A Flock patent also mentions cameras detecting “race.”

Multiple tipsters pointed 404 Media to an exposed online panel which showed various metrics associated with Flock’s AI training.

It included figures on “annotations completed” and “annotator tasks remaining in queue,” with annotations being the notes workers add to reviewed footage to help train AI algorithms. Tasks include categorizing vehicle makes, colors, and types, transcribing license plates, and “audio tasks.” Flock recently started advertising a feature that will detect “screaming.” The panel showed workers sometimes completed thousands upon thousands of annotations over two day periods.

The exposed panel included a list of people tasked with annotating Flock’s footage. Taking those names, 404 Media found some were located in the Philippines, according to their LinkedIn and other online profiles.

Many of these people were employed through Upwork, according to the exposed material. Upwork is a gig and freelance work platform where companies can hire designers and writers or pay for “AI services,” according to Upwork’s website.

The tipsters also pointed to several publicly available Flock presentations which explained in more detail how workers were to categorize the footage. It is not clear what specific camera footage Flock’s AI workers are reviewing. But screenshots included in the worker guides show numerous images from vehicles with US plates, including in New York, Michigan, Florida, New Jersey, and California.

Henderson’s TikTok claimed that when she was dropping off a delivery in Oswego, New York, she found a customer’s front door wide open and inside, a man on the couch with his pants and underwear pulled down to his ankles. Henderson was dubbed the “DoorDash Girl,” and her video accrued tens of millions of views, including some supportive and consoling responses to what she said she had endured on the job as a young woman. Many others on the platform made commentary videos that called into question Henderson's alleged victimhood, defended the customer, and spread misinformation, with TikTok’s algorithm seemingly amplifying these “hot takes.” Then, following Henderson’s November 10 arrest—she has been charged with unlawful surveillance and the dissemination of unlawful surveillance imagery—a new wave of reactions emerged. (Police have dismissed her sexual assault allegation.)

None of these responses came from Black content creator and journalist Mirlie Larose.

But Larose opened TikTok one day to find dozens of messages from friends and supporters alarmed by a video of her responding to the situation in favor of the customer and DoorDash’s decision to terminate Henderson. (Henderson was fired for sharing a customer’s personal information online, DoorDash spokesperson Jenn Rosenberg tells WIRED.) As Larose stared at the video in disbelief, for a split second she second-guessed herself as she became flushed with anxiety about the comment section “tearing her apart.”

“Did I film this?” she asked. “It's my face, it's my hair.”

“Then, within three or four seconds, I noticed something's off. There's no way I said this. I didn't [want to] talk about this topic,” Larose tells WIRED. The video had been AI-generated.

The situation highlights an increasingly common form of digital blackface, buoyed by the rise of generative AI. The term, popularized by culture critic Lauren Michele Jackson, describes various contemporary types of “minstrel performances” on the internet. This looks like the overrepresentation of reaction GIFs, memes, TikToks, and other visual and text-based media that use Black imagery, slang, gestures, and culture. TikTok’s reliance on attention-grabbing short-form video content, coupled with apps like Sora 2, has made it far easier for non-Black creators and bot accounts to adopt racialized stereotypical Black personas using deepfakes. This is also known as digital blackfishing.

In the midst of the DoorDash/Henderson controversy, users on TikTok began to notice two videos in particular: one from a bot account and another from an actual Black content creator parroting the same script. They adopted seemingly DARVO (Deny, Attack, and Reverse Victim and Offender) positions, minimizing the allegations Henderson made and justifying her termination: “I saw the original video posted by the DoorDash girl, and … I understand why DoorDash fired you and why you're blocked from the app.” The videos go on to say, “As for the guy, I can see why everyone is saying he did it on purpose. But when you look at the original video, that couch is not in eye view unless you angle yourself and look over, and if you really want to break it down, he’s inside his house.” In a statement on Facebook, the Oswego City Police Department said the male was “incapacitated and unconscious on his couch due to alcohol consumption” and that the video was taken outside his house. Police also said they “determined that no sexual assault occurred.”",https://www.wired.com/story/the-viral-doordash-girl-saga-unearthed-a-nightmare-for-black-creators/#intcid=_wired-article-bottom-recirc_8ddfa393-7ef7-467d-8bf8-f46fcee3a0c2_roberta-similarity1,2025-11-26 11:30:00+00:00,"When DoorDash delivery driver Livie Rose Henderson posted a video alleging that one of her customers sexually assaulted her in October, it set off a firestorm of reactions.

Backers say it is more transparent than what politicians do. But it has risks.

Kathmandu, Nepal – As Nepal burned on Thursday after two days of deadly unrest that ousted a government accused of corruption, thousands of young people gathered in a heated debate to decide their nation’s next leader.

To them, the country’s mainstream politicians across the major parties were discredited: 14 governments representing three parties have taken turns at governing since 2008, when Nepal adopted a new constitution after abolishing its monarchy.

But in the wake of a brutal crackdown on protesters by security forces that killed at least 72 people, their trust in the country’s political system itself had been shattered. They wanted to select a consensus leader who would steer the country of 30 million people out of chaos and take steps towards stamping out corruption and nepotism. Just not in the way countries usually pick their heads.

So, they chose Nepal’s next leader in a manner unprecedented for any electoral democracy – through a virtual poll on Discord, a United States-based free messaging platform mainly used by online gamers.

The online huddle was organised by Hami Nepal, a Gen Z group behind the protest with more than 160,000 members.

Hami Nepal ran a channel on the platform called Youth Against Corruption, where a fiery debate on the country’s future brought together more than 10,000 people, including many from the Nepali diaspora. As more people tried to log in and failed, a mirrored livestream was held on YouTube to allow about 6,000 more people to see the debate.

After hours of debate that included difficult questions for protest leaders and attempts at reaching out to potential prime minister candidates in real time, the participants chose former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki to lead Nepal. The 73-year-old took the oath of office as the country’s interim prime minister on Friday.

But Nepal’s transition is only beginning, say analysts, and the approach protesters took to choose the country’s leader only underscores how a chaotic new experiment in democracy appears to be under way, with rewards as well as risks.

‘Trying to figure it out together’

The Discord debate was a revolutionary counter to the traditional practice of politicians choosing leaders behind closed doors, which had displayed little transparency, say supporters of the Discord approach.

Discord enables users to connect through texts, voice calls, video calls and media sharing. It also allows communication through direct messages or within community spaces known as servers. It was one of the platforms banned by the government earlier this month alongside two dozen other popular applications, including Instagram, Twitter and YouTube.

The ban, protesters said, was the last straw that spiralled into a nationwide movement against Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s government. The demonstrators accused it of being unrepresentative of young people, as well as of widespread corruption and nepotism.

Tens of thousands of young protesters hit the streets on Tuesday, torching government buildings, including the parliament and residences of top politicians, and forcing Oli to resign. On Friday, President Ramchandra Paudel dissolved parliament and called for a general election in March.

By then, Nepal’s Gen Z protesters had turned to Discord to decide who should lead their nation until March. The social media ban was lifted after the killings earlier in the week.

Virtual polls on mobile screens allowed participants to nominate their interim leader in real time, marking a radical experiment in digital democracy.

“People were learning as they went,” said 25-year-old law graduate Regina Basnet, a protester who had then joined the Discord debate. “Many of us didn’t know what it meant to dissolve parliament or form an interim government. But we were asking questions, getting answers from experts, and trying to figure it out together.”

The discussion revolved around a wide range of issues Nepal must battle now, including jobs, police and university reforms, as well as the state of government healthcare, as the moderators urged the participants to focus on the main question before them: the next leader.

Five names were shortlisted for the final voting: Harka Sampang, a social activist and mayor of the eastern city of Dharan; Mahabir Pun, a popular social activist running the National Innovation Centre; Sagar Dhakal, an independent politician who ran against the powerful Nepali Congress leader, Sher Bahadur Deuba, in 2022; advocate Rastra Bimochan Timalsina, also known as Random Nepali on his YouTube channel, who has been advising the Gen Z protesters; and Karki.

Karki, who emerged as the winner of the poll, had campaigned for an independent judiciary during her brief tenure as chief justice from 2016 to 2017. In 2012, she and another Supreme Court judge jailed a serving minister for corruption. In 2017, the government unsuccessfully tried to impeach her as chief justice after she rejected its choice for police chief.

That history added to her credentials in the eyes of the Discord voters.

“The situation that I have come in, I have not wished to come here. My name was brought from the streets,” she said in an address to the nation after assuming office. “We will not stay here more than six months in any situation. We will complete our responsibilities and pledge to hand over to the next parliament and ministers.”

Many people who took part in the Discord debate also suggested Balen Shah, the popular rapper-turned-mayor of Kathmandu, as their choice for interim prime minister. The Hami Nepal moderators informed the participants they could not reach Shah, who later posted his endorsement of Karki on social media.

Many in Nepal believe Shah could be a frontrunner for the prime minister’s post in the March 5 elections.

‘Much more egalitarian’

Aayush Bashyal, who was part of the Discord discussions, told Al Jazeera he witnessed a “spectrum of understanding, and it was all ‘trial and error’”.

“Some people would come and belittle the ideas, which would paralyse the conversation. However, it was absolutely the need of the moment, and was an impromptu common ground to bring as many voices as possible,” he said.

Bashyal said some in the Discord forum also called for a restoration of Nepal’s monarchy, which was abolished in 2006 after a decade-long rebellion by left-wing forces in the country.

“There was also a pro-monarchy Discord group going on side by side. Sometimes, people would share the screenshots from their chats,” the 27-year-old student of public administration at Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan University told Al Jazeera. He branded the pro-monarchy group as “infiltrators”.

In the same forum, some Gen Z participants even questioned the legitimacy of the protest leaders. “You made the agenda, but we don’t know you. How we can trust you is also another issue,” one participant said.

Other issues that came up during the deliberations included investigating the killings of protesters and cracking down on corruption.

‘This is the future’

Pranaya Rana, a journalist who sends out the popular Kalam Weekly newsletter to more than 4,300 subscribers, said that using Discord made sense for a Gen Z-led movement, but that it also came with challenges.

“It is much more egalitarian than a physical forum that many might not have access to. Since it is virtual and anonymous, people can also say what they want to without fear of retaliation,” he told Al Jazeera. “But there are also challenges, in that anyone could easily manipulate users by infiltration, and using multiple accounts to sway opinions and votes.”

Aware of how misinformation, fake news and rumours could derail such movements, the Gen Z leaders also launched a sub-room called “fact checks” on their Discord discussion page.

Among the things they debunked was a photo showing protest leader Sudan Gurung, the chief negotiator for the formation of the interim government, with Arzu Rana Deuba, the ousted foreign minister. The picture was falsely claimed to have been taken a week before, when it was actually from an event that had happened six months earlier. Gurung had met the minister to demand justice for a Nepali student who had died by suicide after he was allegedly harassed at an engineering college in neighbouring India’s Odisha state.

There were also rumours that Gurung was not a Nepali citizen, but from Darjeeling, a hill town in eastern India. A copy of his Nepali citizenship card was released in the Discord discussion room and on social media.

The Gen Z organisers also debunked claims that former King Gyanendra had met the protesters. It was found that an old video of Nepal’s last monarch interacting with youngsters was being shared on social media.

It was also discovered that multiple social media handles and profiles claiming to be the “official” youth movement had contributed to some confusion on the ground. On Thursday night, a Gen Z leader was even seen calling a Nepal military officer on the phone, warning him against potential royal interference in the formation of the next government.

Rana, the journalist, said the protest leaders made good use of technology, “something that Gen Z is best at”.

“This is the future. We can either remain in the days of giving speeches on stages with mics or get used to talking freely on online platforms,” he told Al Jazeera.

“Gen Z is naive, but that’s to be expected. They are young, but they have shown a willingness to learn, and that’s the important part.”

Anticorruption activist and the former president of Transparency International Nepal, Padmini Pradhanang, urged Gen Z protest leaders to work on what the previous governments “miserably failed at – integrity, accountability, transparency and good governance”.

“These young people have only experienced kleptocracy. They have never seen true democracy or good governance,” she said.

But law graduate Basnet is not sure.

“At first, it was a peaceful protest. The mood was celebratory. But the state-ordered carnage later was traumatising… The uprising and burning of private and public properties was scary, and then, with people participating in a discussion on social media to form the government has only added to the confusion,” she told Al Jazeera.

“All these events that unfolded worry me.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/15/more-egalitarian-how-nepals-gen-z-used-gaming-app-discord-to-pick-pm#main-content-area,2025-09-15 00:00:00,"It was a first for an electoral democracy.

Virtual polls on mobile screens allowed participants to nominate their interim leader in real time, marking a radical experiment in digital democracy. “People were learning as they went,” said 25-year-old law graduate Regina Basnet, a protester who had then joined the Discord debate. “Many of us didn’t know what it meant to dissolve parliament or form an interim government. But we were asking questions, getting answers from experts, and trying to figure it out together.” The discussion revolved around a wide range of issues Nepal must battle now, including jobs, police and university reforms, as well as the state of government healthcare, as the moderators urged the participants to focus on the main question before them: the next leader. Five names were shortlisted for the final voting: Harka Sampang, a social activist and mayor of the eastern city of Dharan; Mahabir Pun, a popular social activist running the National Innovation Centre; Sagar Dhakal, an independent politician who ran against the powerful Nepali Congress leader, Sher Bahadur Deuba, in 2022; advocate Rastra Bimochan Timalsina, also known as Random Nepali on his YouTube channel, who has been advising the Gen Z protesters; and Karki. Advertisement Karki, who emerged as the winner of the poll, had campaigned for an independent judiciary during her brief tenure as chief justice from 2016 to 2017. In 2012, she and another Supreme Court judge jailed a serving minister for corruption. In 2017, the government unsuccessfully tried to impeach her as chief justice after she rejected its choice for police chief. That history added to her credentials in the eyes of the Discord voters. “The situation that I have come in, I have not wished to come here. My name was brought from the streets,” she said in an address to the nation after assuming office. “We will not stay here more than six months in any situation. We will complete our responsibilities and pledge to hand over to the next parliament and ministers.” Many people who took part in the Discord debate also suggested Balen Shah, the popular rapper-turned-mayor of Kathmandu, as their choice for interim prime minister. The Hami Nepal moderators informed the participants they could not reach Shah, who later posted his endorsement of Karki on social media. Many in Nepal believe Shah could be a frontrunner for the prime minister’s post in the March 5 elections. ‘Much more egalitarian’ Aayush Bashyal, who was part of the Discord discussions, told Al Jazeera he witnessed a “spectrum of understanding, and it was all ‘trial and error’”. “Some people would come and belittle the ideas, which would paralyse the conversation. However, it was absolutely the need of the moment, and was an impromptu common ground to bring as many voices as possible,” he said. Bashyal said some in the Discord forum also called for a restoration of Nepal’s monarchy, which was abolished in 2006 after a decade-long rebellion by left-wing forces in the country. “There was also a pro-monarchy Discord group going on side by side. Sometimes, people would share the screenshots from their chats,” the 27-year-old student of public administration at Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan University told Al Jazeera. He branded the pro-monarchy group as “infiltrators”. In the same forum, some Gen Z participants even questioned the legitimacy of the protest leaders. “You made the agenda, but we don’t know you. How we can trust you is also another issue,” one participant said. Other issues that came up during the deliberations included investigating the killings of protesters and cracking down on corruption. ‘This is the future’ Pranaya Rana, a journalist who sends out the popular Kalam Weekly newsletter to more than 4,300 subscribers, said that using Discord made sense for a Gen Z-led movement, but that it also came with challenges. “It is much more egalitarian than a physical forum that many might not have access to. Since it is virtual and anonymous, people can also say what they want to without fear of retaliation,” he told Al Jazeera. “But there are also challenges, in that anyone could easily manipulate users by infiltration, and using multiple accounts to sway opinions and votes.” Advertisement Aware of how misinformation, fake news and rumours could derail such movements, the Gen Z leaders also launched a sub-room called “fact checks” on their Discord discussion page. Among the things they debunked was a photo showing protest leader Sudan Gurung, the chief negotiator for the formation of the interim government, with Arzu Rana Deuba, the ousted foreign minister. The picture was falsely claimed to have been taken a week before, when it was actually from an event that had happened six months earlier. Gurung had met the minister to demand justice for a Nepali student who had died by suicide after he was allegedly harassed at an engineering college in neighbouring India’s Odisha state. There were also rumours that Gurung was not a Nepali citizen, but from Darjeeling, a hill town in eastern India. A copy of his Nepali citizenship card was released in the Discord discussion room and on social media. The Gen Z organisers also debunked claims that former King Gyanendra had met the protesters. It was found that an old video of Nepal’s last monarch interacting with youngsters was being shared on social media. It was also discovered that multiple social media handles and profiles claiming to be the “official” youth movement had contributed to some confusion on the ground. On Thursday night, a Gen Z leader was even seen calling a Nepal military officer on the phone, warning him against potential royal interference in the formation of the next government. Rana, the journalist, said the protest leaders made good use of technology, “something that Gen Z is best at”. “This is the future. We can either remain in the days of giving speeches on stages with mics or get used to talking freely on online platforms,” he told Al Jazeera. “Gen Z is naive, but that’s to be expected. They are young, but they have shown a willingness to learn, and that’s the important part.” Anticorruption activist and the former president of Transparency International Nepal, Padmini Pradhanang, urged Gen Z protest leaders to work on what the previous governments “miserably failed at – integrity, accountability, transparency and good governance”. “These young people have only experienced kleptocracy. They have never seen true democracy or good governance,” she said. But law graduate Basnet is not sure. “At first, it was a peaceful protest. The mood was celebratory. But the state-ordered carnage later was traumatising… The uprising and burning of private and public properties was scary, and then, with people participating in a discussion on social media to form the government has only added to the confusion,” she told Al Jazeera. “All these events that unfolded worry me.”",0.0939605983499112,0.4266900190564313,neutral,"{'neg': 0.127, 'neu': 0.784, 'pos': 0.089, 'compound': -0.9972}",negative

Australia is mourning the victims of Sydney’s Bondi Beach attack.

Vigils were held a day after two armed men killed 15 people at a Jewish Hanukkah celebration on Sunday.

At least 40 people remain in hospital following the attack, including two police officers who are in a serious but stable condition, police said. They said the shooting suspects are a father-son duo.

Here is what we know about the victims and the shooting suspects.

What do we know about the Bondi Beach shooting victims?

The victims were aged between 10 and 87 years, according to the police. Here is what we know about eight of the 15 victims, based on local media reports:

Rabbi Eli Schlanger

The 41-year-old was an assistant rabbi at Chabad Bondi, a global Jewish organisation that had organised Sunday’s event at a park near the famous beach. Schlanger was British-born but had lived in Sydney for the past 18 years, and had recently become a father for the fifth time.

His friend Alex Ryvchin, who is also co-CEO of the executive council of Australian Jewry, said that Schlanger spent time with prisoners in jails and the elderly at the public housing societies. “He would listen to their stories, feed them and make sure they had meals and kosher products. He was the sort of person who illuminated our lives with kindness, his grace and generosity,” Ryvchin said.

Schlanger’s brother-in-law, Rabbi Mendel Kastel, said the family was “broken”. “They have fallen apart,” Kastel told the Reuters news agency.

Peter Meagher

A retired policeman and longtime rugby volunteer, Meagher was struck down while working as a freelance photographer at the event, Randwick Rugby Club said in a statement.

“‘Marzo’ as he was universally known, was a much loved figure and absolute legend in our club, with decades of voluntary involvement, he was one of the heart and soul figures of Randwick Rugby,” the club said.

“The tragic irony is that he spent so long in the dangerous front line as a Police Officer and was struck down in retirement while taking photos in his passion role is really hard to comprehend,” it said.

“For him it was simply a catastrophic case of being in the wrong place and at the wrong time.”

Dan Elkayam

French President Emmanuel Macron confirmed that a French national, Dan Elkayam, was killed in the attack.

Elkayam, who local media reported was in his late 20s and had gone down to celebrate at the festival, had been providing technical support to global media company NBC Universal in Sydney since last December, according to his LinkedIn page.

He played with the Rockdale Ilinden Football Club premier league squad, where he was “an extremely talented and popular figure”, the club said on social media.

Matilda

A primary school student, 10-year-old Matilda, died on Sunday night, her aunt confirmed on social media.

In a statement posted on Facebook, the Harmony Russian School of Sydney said Matilda was a former student. “We honor her life and the time she spent as part of our school family,” the post said.

In local media reports, she has been described as a “bright, joyful, and spirited child who brought light to those around her”.

Reuven Morrison

A Chabad report described Morrison, another victim, as “a member of the Chabad community who divided his time between Melbourne and Sydney”.

Alex Kleytman

The 87-year-old Holocaust survivor attended Sunday’s event with his wife, Larisa, also a Holocaust survivor, their children and grandchildren, Chabad and local media reported.

The couple had recounted their experiences to aged-care provider JewishCare, which referred to Alex’s harrowing memories of the “dreadful conditions in Siberia, where he, along with his mother and younger brother, struggled for survival”.

The “scars of the past” did not deter them from seeking a brighter future in Australia, as they emigrated from Ukraine, JewishCare wrote in its 2022-23 annual report.

Rabbi Yaakov Levitan

Levitan served as secretary of the Sydney Jewish religious organisation Beth Din, Chabad said.

Tibor Weitzen

Weitzen has been identified as one of the victims after he was fatally wounded while shielding his wife from the gunfire, who survived the attack, the Daily Mail reported.

What do we know about the Bondi Beach attack suspects?

During a news conference on Monday, New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said the suspects were a 50-year-old and his 24-year-old son.

“What’s really important is to say we do have a 24-year-old male in hospital at the moment,” Lanyon said.

“Based on his medical condition, it is likely that that person may face criminal charges. I’m very mindful of not prejudicing any prosecution of that person, if they’re put before the court.”

Lanyon added that the father, who was killed by police at the scene, “is a licensed firearms holder who had six firearms licensed to him”, emphasising that he “met the eligibility criteria for a firearms licence”.

He said authorities were not looking for any other suspect.

Some Australian news outlets, including the public broadcaster ABC, identified the suspects as Sajid Akram, 50, and Naveed Akram, 24.

Since the declaration of a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip on October 10, 2025, Israel has violated the agreement with near-daily attacks, killing hundreds of people.

Israel violated the ceasefire agreement at least 738 times from October 10 to December 12, through the continuation of attacks by air, artillery and direct shootings, the Government Media Office in Gaza reports.

The office said Israel shot at civilians 205 times, raided residential areas beyond the “yellow line” 37 times, bombed and shelled Gaza 358 times, and demolished people’s properties on 138 occasions. It added that Israel had also detained 43 Palestinians from Gaza over the past month.

Israel has also continued to block vital humanitarian aid and destroy homes and infrastructure across the Strip.

Al Jazeera has tracked the ceasefire violations to date.

What are the terms of the ceasefire?

On September 29, the United States unveiled a 20-point proposal to end Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, release the remaining captives held in the enclave, allow the full entry of humanitarian aid into the besieged territory and outline a three-phase withdrawal of Israeli forces.

Some of the main conditions of the first phase, which is ongoing, include:

An end to hostilities in Gaza between Israel and Hamas

Lifting the blockade of all aid into Gaza by Israel and stopping its interference in aid distribution

Release of all captives held in Gaza – alive or dead – by Hamas

Release of some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and disappeared people from Israeli jails

Withdrawal of Israeli forces to the “yellow line”

Following mediation by partners including Egypt, Qatar, and Turkiye, representatives from some 30 countries gathered on October 13 for a ceremony to sign the Gaza ceasefire agreement, led by US President Donald Trump.

However, Israel and Hamas were notably absent, raising doubts about the summit’s ability to achieve tangible progress towards ending the war and resolving the core issues of Israel’s occupation and the 18-year-long siege of Gaza.

Israel has pledged not to allow a Palestinian state, and the US has continued its large-scale arms transfers and diplomatic backing to Israel throughout its genocidal war on Gaza, while offering only vague statements about Gaza’s future.

Israel attacks Gaza nearly every day

According to an analysis by Al Jazeera, Israel has attacked Gaza on 56 out of the past 67 days of the ceasefire, meaning there were only 11 days during which no violent attacks, deaths or injuries were reported.

Despite continuing attacks, the US insists that the “ceasefire” is still holding.

Israel still killing Palestinians

Since the ceasefire took effect at noon on October 10, Israel has killed at least 391 Palestinians and injured 1,063, according to the latest figures from the Palestinian Ministry of Health.

On October 19 and 29 – two of the deadliest days since the latest ceasefire – Israel killed a total of 154 people.

On October 19, accusing Hamas of violating the ceasefire after two Israeli soldiers were killed in Rafah, Israeli forces killed 45 people in a massive wave of air raids across the Gaza Strip.

Hamas’s armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, pointed out that Israel controls the Rafah area and it had no contact with any Palestinian fighters there.

On October 29, Israel killed 109 people, including 52 children, after an exchange of gunfire in Rafah that killed one Israeli soldier.

“The Israelis hit back, and they should hit back,” Trump told reporters, calling Israel’s attacks “retribution” for the soldier’s death.

On November 22, at least 21 Palestinians were killed in a spate of Israeli drone and missile attacks throughout northern and central Gaza, with dozens of others wounded.

Here are the latest figures from the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza, tracking the casualties from October 7, 2023, through December 14, 2025:

Confirmed killed: at least 70,663 people, including 20,179 children

at least 70,663 people, including 20,179 children Injured: at least 171,139 people

Israel still choking aid

The ceasefire stipulated that “full aid will be immediately sent into the Gaza Strip”. However, the reality on the ground remains very different.

According to the World Food Programme (WFP), only half the required food aid is currently reaching Gaza, while a coalition of Palestinian relief agencies says total aid deliveries amount to just one-quarter of what was agreed under the ceasefire.

From October 10 to December 14, only 8,391 trucks have reached their intended destinations inside Gaza, according to the UN2720 Monitoring and Tracking Dashboard, which monitors humanitarian aid in Gaza.

According to truck drivers, aid deliveries are facing significant delays, with Israeli inspections taking much longer than expected.

According to the Gaza Government Media Office, over a 62-day period 14,534 trucks entered Gaza out of 37,200, averaging 234 trucks per day. That is only 39 percent of the trucks allocated.

In addition, Israel has blocked essential and nutritious food items, including meat, dairy, and vegetables, crucial for a balanced diet. Instead, non-nutritious foodstuffs are being allowed, such as snacks, chocolate, crisps, and soft drinks.

Has Hamas released all of the captives?

On October 13, as per the ceasefire deal, Hamas released all 20 remaining living Israeli captives in exchange for 250 Palestinians serving long prison sentences and 1,700 Palestinians disappeared by Israel since October 7, 2023.

As part of the deal, Hamas is also expected to return the bodies of 28 Israeli captives in exchange for 360 Palestinian bodies held by Israel.

As of December 3, Hamas had returned 27 Israeli captives’ bodies, with only one remaining in Gaza. The group has said it requires heavy excavation equipment to recover the remaining captive’s body buried under the rubble from Israeli bombardment.

Israel has so far returned more than 300 Palestinian bodies, many of which were mutilated and showed signs of torture. Many remain unidentified.

What does international law say about ceasefires?

According to the Lieber Institute, a ceasefire is designed to halt active combat, or “freeze a conflict in place”, but it can be ambiguous in international law.

The suspension of hostilities is best understood as a cessation of active hostile military operations.

Resuming hostilities would breach political agreements, but it might not be a violation of international law unless the ceasefire was part of a binding treaty or United Nations Security Council resolution.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/how-many-times-has-israel-violated-the-gaza-ceasefire-here-are-the-numbers,2025-11-11 00:00:00,"Since the ceasefire took effect, Israeli attacks have killed at least 391 Palestinians and injured 1,063.

Nepal’s new prime minister has called for calm and urged her compatriots to “get together to rebuild the country” after violent protests against corruption killed at least 72 people and injured hundreds more.

In her first public remarks since becoming the Himalayan nation’s interim prime minister on Friday, Sushila Karki said on Sunday that the country must listen to its young citizens.

“We have to work according to the thinking of the Gen Z generation,” the 73-year-old former chief justice said, referring to the demographic that led the anticorruption protests.

“What this group is demanding is the end of corruption, good governance and economic equality,” she noted.

Karki added that she had not wished to lead but her name was “brought from the streets”.

She was made interim prime minister after several days of negotiations among protest leaders, President Ramchandra Paudel and army chief Ashok Raj Sigdel.

Late on Friday, Paudel announced her appointment, saying parliament had been dissolved and elections had been set for March 5.

“We will not stay here more than six months in any situation. We will complete our responsibilities and pledge to hand over to the next parliament and ministers,” Karki said on Sunday.

State TV reported that the new prime minister, who held a minute of silence on Sunday for those killed in the protests, has promised the families of those slain by police that they will each receive about 1 million rupees (about $11,330).

The worst unrest in Nepal for decades was sparked by a short-lived social media ban. Tens of thousands of people took to the streets to show their anger over widespread graft and poverty.

Police opened fire on protesters on Monday in the Nepalese capital, Kathmandu. Demonstrators then torched the president’s office, ministry buildings and the homes of high-profile politicians.

Amid the chaos, KP Sharma Oli quit as prime minister on Tuesday.

Sudan Gurung, the 36-year-old founder of the NGO Hami Nepal (We Are Nepal), played a prominent role in the anticorruption demonstrations.

“I will make sure that the power lies with the people and bring every corrupt politician to justice,” he promised.

On Sunday, Gurung and his team were reportedly in meetings to help decide key government positions, according to members of Hami Nepal.

In her first public remarks since becoming the Himalayan nation’s interim prime minister on Friday, Sushila Karki said on Sunday that the country must listen to its young citizens. “We have to work according to the thinking of the Gen Z generation,” the 73-year-old former chief justice said, referring to the demographic that led the anticorruption protests. “What this group is demanding is the end of corruption, good governance and economic equality,” she noted. Karki added that she had not wished to lead but her name was “brought from the streets”. She was made interim prime minister after several days of negotiations among protest leaders, President Ramchandra Paudel and army chief Ashok Raj Sigdel. Late on Friday, Paudel announced her appointment, saying parliament had been dissolved and elections had been set for March 5. “We will not stay here more than six months in any situation. We will complete our responsibilities and pledge to hand over to the next parliament and ministers,” Karki said on Sunday. State TV reported that the new prime minister, who held a minute of silence on Sunday for those killed in the protests, has promised the families of those slain by police that they will each receive about 1 million rupees (about $11,330). The worst unrest in Nepal for decades was sparked by a short-lived social media ban. Tens of thousands of people took to the streets to show their anger over widespread graft and poverty.

Nepal will vote in early March, says the president, as an interim government headed by the country’s first female prime minister takes charge after historic public protests.

Hours after appointing former chief justice and anticorruption figure Sushila Karki as the new head of government, President Ramchandra Paudel announced in a statement late on Friday that the 275-seat parliament has been dissolved and elections are fixed for March 5.

The Himalayan nation of 30 million people, wedged between China and India, is slowly returning to normal, less than a week after widespread Gen Z-led protests following a government ban on social media platforms.

Authorities began easing restrictions on Saturday, with curfew and prohibitory orders lifted in the capital, Kathmandu, though sensitive areas remain off-limits to the public.

The protests evolved into a broader movement against alleged corruption and nepotism among the political elite, with demonstrators setting fire to the parliament, the residences of top politicians, and other public buildings, and forcing Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli to step down.

At least 51 people, including 21 protesters, nine prisoners, three police officers and 18 others, were killed in protests since Monday, police said. About 1,000 prisoners who escaped from multiple jails countrywide were returned, but over 12,500 others remain on the run, according to the police.

The anger among Nepalese protesters was also rooted in economic malaise, with many young people dissatisfied with how they struggle to get by as political leaders and their offspring enjoy luxurious lifestyles.

Many Gen Z youth and others said they are frustrated by a lack of employment, especially in rural areas, something that has driven millions to seek work in other countries across the Middle East, as well as in South Korea and Malaysia.

Karki was appointed the interim prime minister after two days of intense negotiations between President Paudel, army chief Ashok Raj Sigdel and the protest leaders behind Nepal’s worst upheaval in years.

News of Karki’s appointment was welcomed by neighbouring India, whose Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his congratulations in a post on X. “India is fully committed to the peace, progress, and prosperity of Nepal’s brothers and sisters,” he wrote.

Nepal’s former Chief Justice Sushila Karki has been named the country’s interim prime minister following deadly protests this week that killed at least 51 people, injured more than 1,300, and led to the escape of thousands of prisoners.

On Friday, President Ramchandra Poudel’s office announced the appointment of Karki, the country’s first female head of government. The 73-year-old, the only woman to have served as chief justice of Nepal’s Supreme Court, was sworn in late Friday by Poudel at the presidential residence in a ceremony that aired on state-run television.

Police spokesperson Binod Ghimire said on Friday that those killed so far this week included 21 protesters, nine prisoners, three police officers and 18 others, without elaborating. Another 1,300 people were injured as police fought to control crowds.

Ghimire added that more than 12,500 prisoners who escaped from multiple jails countrywide remain on the run. “About 13,500 prisoners had escaped — some have been recaptured, 12,533 are still at large.”

The dead included prisoners killed during or after their escape in clashes with Nepalese security forces.

Some of the fugitives have reportedly tried to cross into India, where scores have been apprehended by Indian border forces.

Nepal’s army, which has imposed a curfew, said that it had recovered more than 100 guns looted in the turmoil, with some protesters seen brandishing automatic rifles.

“They [Gen Z] want [Karki]. This will happen today,” a constitutional expert consulted by Poudel and Sigdel, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters news agency before the announcement.

Karki is “seen as an anticorruption voice, so she’s acceptable to a lot of the Gen Z groups that have been firing up this movement, because corruption has been a big issue,” said Al Jazeera’s Rob McBride, reporting from the capital Kathmandu.

“But while she’s popular with them, she’s not necessarily popular with other groups … so she’s seen as a consensus candidate.”

McBride noted that there was uncertainty about whether Karki could serve as an interim prime minister because she is not a member of parliament. But one Gen Z leader reportedly said an agreement had been made to dissolve parliament, enabling Karki’s appointment.

Still, said McBride, “Nepal is in for a long period of political uncertainty.”

On Monday, 21 protesters were killed during a police crackdown on demonstrations against a government ban on social media, corruption and poor governance.

On Tuesday, protesters set the parliament ablaze, Oli resigned, and the army took charge of the streets.

Wedged between India and China, Nepal has grappled with political and economic instability since the abolition of its monarchy in 2008, while a lack of jobs drives millions to seek work in other countries and send money home.

Shops began reopening on Friday, and cars again filled the streets while police held batons instead of the guns they carried earlier in the week — signs that normalcy may be returning in Kathmandu.

That’s because of Nepal’s geography – and its history balancing regional powers.

Islamabad, Pakistan – On Sunday, Nepal’s then-Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli mocked youth protesters, who were planning a major agitation the following day in the capital, Kathmandu, against corruption and nepotism.

By calling themselves the “Gen Z”, the protesters seemed to believe they could demand whatever they wanted, he said.

Less than 48 hours later, Oli was an ex-PM, and the Gen Z protest movement he had spoken dismissively of was discussing who should lead Nepal. That was after police firing on protesters on Monday killed at least 19 people, further inflaming passions. On Tuesday, protesters set fire to the parliament building and homes of several prominent politicians, as members of Oli’s cabinet quit and pressure mounted on the PM himself – ultimately leading to his resignation. The combined death toll from clashes on Monday and Tuesday has now reached 31.

Those dramatic events have turned the Himalayan nation into the latest cauldron of political change, after similar youth-led movements in Sri Lanka‚ in 2022, and Bangladesh, in 2024, also led to the overthrow of governments in those South Asian nations.

Experts say that Nepal’s political churn has consequences not just for the nation of 30 million people, but for the broader region and the world, rooted in the country’s own tumultuous political history and its legacy of balancing ties between India, China and Pakistan.

Here’s what happened and why it matters to the world:

What’s happening in Nepal?

On September 8, tens of thousands of young people came out to protest corruption and nepotism. A government ban on social media platforms only aggravated their anger.

After some protesters broke through barricades and entered the parliament complex, security forces fired live bullets, tear gas shells and water cannons at them. At least 19 people died, angering youth across the country.

New protests – far more violent – erupted on Tuesday. Politicians’ homes and offices of political parties were broken into and set on fire. The building that housed Kantipur Publications, Nepal’s biggest media house, was also torched.

By afternoon, Oli had announced his resignation, but the protesters, who have described their agitation as a “Gen Z movement”, are now demanding the dissolution of parliament, new elections, an interim government they help choose until then, and the prosecution of those who ordered the firing on September 8.

The army has taken over the streets, and a curfew is in place in Kathmandu.

But this was not Nepal’s first encounter with mass student unrest. The country’s modern political history is filled with student movements, palace interventions and cycles of violence, including a decade-long civil war.

From Rana rule to the Panchayat era

Several educated Nepalis had participated in undivided India’s freedom struggle against the British, and inspired by the subcontinent’s independence from colonial rule in 1947, became a part of a larger movement calling for the end of direct rule by Nepal’s Rana monarchy.

In 1951, opposition to the Ranas – including from educated sections of the elite – culminated in what was the country’s first modern revolution. The Ranas were forced to accept indirect rule through a tripartite agreement. Nepal’s King Tribhuvan, who had fled to India in the protests, returned. A government was formed with members of the Rana clan and the Nepali Congress (NC) – the main political party at the time.

Then, in 1959, the country held its first general election, with the NC’s Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala becoming prime minister. But just a year later, King Mahendra Bir Bikram dismissed the Koirala government after its popular land reforms angered sections of the country’s ruling elite. Instead, the king imposed what became known as the “panchayat” system, a party-less order that governed Nepal for nearly three decades, with the monarch at its helm.

With political activity curtailed, student protests became one of the few outlets for dissent. Campus agitations over political and educational reforms occurred through the 1970s and 1980s.

The sustained political protest over the years eventually brought down the panchayat system in 1990 and reopened the door to parliamentary politics.

The armed rebellion and the emergence of a republic

Between 1996 and 2006, the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) waged a rebel-led war aimed at toppling the monarchy for democratic rule. The conflict killed more than 10,000 people.

In 2006, protests involving political parties, civil society and students forced the monarch, King Gyanendra, to cede power. The movement paved the way for the abolition of the monarchy and, in 2008, the declaration of Nepal as a democratic republic.

Since then, eight men from the three main parties – the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) (CPN-UML), the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre) (CPN-MC) and the Nepali Congress (NC) – have led the country 14 times between them. Oli, who resigned on September 9, was serving his fourth term.

Observers say that though the Oli government’s recent social media ban was a lightning rod for protesters, the Gen Z movement is built on underlying grievances that have simmered for years.

Rajneesh Bhandari, an investigative journalist based in Kathmandu, says the demonstrations reflected “frustration” against the rulers for their “corruption, acts of nepotism, and their bad governance”.

“This shows that the Nepalese youth held resentment against the rulers who did not pay heed to their demands, or communicated with them, and continued to act in an arrogant manner,” he told Al Jazeera.

Ashirwad Tripathy, a civil and digital rights activist in Kathmandu, also emphasised that the protests were not an overnight eruption.

“The abuse of authority and corruption of the leaders of the several political parties have led to this situation. There has been long-simmering discontent and dissatisfaction against the older generation of the three main political parties, who only played musical chairs with the prime minister’s seat,” Tripathy told Al Jazeera.

Geography, neighbours and power politics

But what happens in Nepal matters well beyond the borders of the landlocked country that sits on the southern slopes of the Himalayas and is home to eight of the world’s 14 highest peaks, including Mount Everest.

Stretching roughly 885km (550 miles) east to west and about 193km (120 miles) north to south, it lies between two regional giants: China to the north and India to the south, east and west.

Though historically close to India, Nepal’s foreign alignments have shifted with domestic politics. Oli was widely seen as leaning towards Beijing, and his removal has prompted speculation about a recalibration of influence in Kathmandu.

Lokranjan Parajauli, a social scientist who has written extensively on social movements and politics, suggested the next ruler is likely to be an “independent” figure not aligned with any party.

“It is not quite clear who that new person will be, but it will be someone whom the army can trust or rely upon,” Parajauli told Al Jazeera.

Some analysts point to Sushila Karki, the former chief justice, as a possible interim choice.

“She is the most acceptable candidate, and she has a high chance of leading the next government, but no decision has been made,” Tripathy said, adding that Karki’s political and diplomatic allegiances are unclear.

Others believe that the mayor of Kathmandu, Balendra Shah, a 35-year-old rapper musician who has been heading the city since 2022, could be the other option.

However, a longtime human rights activist in Kathmandu, speaking on condition of anonymity, said regardless of the identity of the new leader, both India and China will seek stability and a government that “respects their interests”.

“Neither neighbour wants to see the other exercise too much influence in Nepal,” the activist told Al Jazeera.

Tripathy emphasised Nepal’s historical balancing act.

“Nepal has always had friendly ties with both its neighbours, China and India. Culturally, we are closer to India in the southern part, while the northern part has cultural similarities with China. But our motto has always been to maintain a balanced relationship between both countries, and we will continue the same notion,” he said.

Regional calculus

Ali Hassan, a South Asia specialist at UK-based Healix, a risk management company, argued that Oli’s fall could serve as a setback for Beijing in Kathmandu and a potential opening for New Delhi.

Sections of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have also been aligned with the pro-monarchist movement in Nepal, which argues that the Himalayan nation needs the Ranas back in power. The former monarch, Gyanendra, received a huge public reception in Kathmandu earlier this year, pointing to the continuing support for the former rulers among sections of Nepali society. If the pro-monarchy movement gains from the current politicial crisis in Nepal, that might benefit the BJP, Hassan said.

But he added that the Gen Z protesters who removed Oli do not appear to favour a return of Gyanendra.

Meanwhile, Pakistan will also be watching developments in Nepal closely, say analysts.

Compared with India and China, Nepal’s relations with Pakistan have historically been cordial but limited in strategic significance.

Still, Nepal’s rulers have used ties with Pakistan, at times, to remind India of their own regional options. In 1960, the Indian government under Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru criticised King Mahendra’s dismissal of the Koirala government. A year later, the Nepali monarch visited Pakistan, and then, in 1963, hosted Pakistani President Ayub Khan.

More recently, at the height of India-Pakistan tensions in May, after gunmen had killed 26 civilians in Indian-administered Kashmir, Nepal hosted a delegation from Pakistan’s National Defence University, leading to raised eyebrows in New Delhi, which has long viewed Oli as too close to Beijing – Pakistan’s closest ally – for comfort.

With Pakistan having seen its share of political chaos in recent years, particularly after the removal of Prime Minister Imran Khan through a parliamentary vote of no confidence in 2022, analysts say Nepal’s crisis might have raised concerns among Pakistan’s ruling elite, too.

“Pakistani elites must be wondering how secure their grip on power is, given they are often accused of charges similar to what Bangladeshi, Sri Lankan and Nepali protesters said of their leaders, that the government is indifferent to all but themselves and is highly authoritarian,” London-based Hassan said.

But the Kathmandu-based human rights activist who requested anonymity said that from Nepal’s perspective, Pakistan would likely not be a priority for the next leader – whoever it is.

“Nepal has friendly relations with Pakistan, but unlike India or China, Pakistan relations are not seen as a factor in Nepali domestic politics, nor do Nepali governments have distinctive policies towards Pakistan,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/11/why-does-nepals-crisis-matter-to-south-asia-and-the-world,2025-09-11 00:00:00,"China, India and Pakistan will all be watching the events in Nepal closely, say experts.

Ashirwad Tripathy, a civil and digital rights activist in Kathmandu, also emphasised that the protests were not an overnight eruption. “The abuse of authority and corruption of the leaders of the several political parties have led to this situation. There has been long-simmering discontent and dissatisfaction against the older generation of the three main political parties, who only played musical chairs with the prime minister’s seat,” Tripathy told Al Jazeera. Geography, neighbours and power politics But what happens in Nepal matters well beyond the borders of the landlocked country that sits on the southern slopes of the Himalayas and is home to eight of the world’s 14 highest peaks, including Mount Everest. Stretching roughly 885km (550 miles) east to west and about 193km (120 miles) north to south, it lies between two regional giants: China to the north and India to the south, east and west. Though historically close to India, Nepal’s foreign alignments have shifted with domestic politics. Oli was widely seen as leaning towards Beijing, and his removal has prompted speculation about a recalibration of influence in Kathmandu. Lokranjan Parajauli, a social scientist who has written extensively on social movements and politics, suggested the next ruler is likely to be an “independent” figure not aligned with any party. “It is not quite clear who that new person will be, but it will be someone whom the army can trust or rely upon,” Parajauli told Al Jazeera. Some analysts point to Sushila Karki, the former chief justice, as a possible interim choice. “She is the most acceptable candidate, and she has a high chance of leading the next government, but no decision has been made,” Tripathy said, adding that Karki’s political and diplomatic allegiances are unclear. Others believe that the mayor of Kathmandu, Balendra Shah, a 35-year-old rapper musician who has been heading the city since 2022, could be the other option. Advertisement However, a longtime human rights activist in Kathmandu, speaking on condition of anonymity, said regardless of the identity of the new leader, both India and China will seek stability and a government that “respects their interests”. “Neither neighbour wants to see the other exercise too much influence in Nepal,” the activist told Al Jazeera. Tripathy emphasised Nepal’s historical balancing act. “Nepal has always had friendly ties with both its neighbours, China and India. Culturally, we are closer to India in the southern part, while the northern part has cultural similarities with China. But our motto has always been to maintain a balanced relationship between both countries, and we will continue the same notion,” he said. Regional calculus Ali Hassan, a South Asia specialist at UK-based Healix, a risk management company, argued that Oli’s fall could serve as a setback for Beijing in Kathmandu and a potential opening for New Delhi. Sections of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have also been aligned with the pro-monarchist movement in Nepal, which argues that the Himalayan nation needs the Ranas back in power. The former monarch, Gyanendra, received a huge public reception in Kathmandu earlier this year, pointing to the continuing support for the former rulers among sections of Nepali society. If the pro-monarchy movement gains from the current politicial crisis in Nepal, that might benefit the BJP, Hassan said. But he added that the Gen Z protesters who removed Oli do not appear to favour a return of Gyanendra. Meanwhile, Pakistan will also be watching developments in Nepal closely, say analysts. Compared with India and China, Nepal’s relations with Pakistan have historically been cordial but limited in strategic significance. Still, Nepal’s rulers have used ties with Pakistan, at times, to remind India of their own regional options. In 1960, the Indian government under Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru criticised King Mahendra’s dismissal of the Koirala government. A year later, the Nepali monarch visited Pakistan, and then, in 1963, hosted Pakistani President Ayub Khan. More recently, at the height of India-Pakistan tensions in May, after gunmen had killed 26 civilians in Indian-administered Kashmir, Nepal hosted a delegation from Pakistan’s National Defence University, leading to raised eyebrows in New Delhi, which has long viewed Oli as too close to Beijing – Pakistan’s closest ally – for comfort. With Pakistan having seen its share of political chaos in recent years, particularly after the removal of Prime Minister Imran Khan through a parliamentary vote of no confidence in 2022, analysts say Nepal’s crisis might have raised concerns among Pakistan’s ruling elite, too. “Pakistani elites must be wondering how secure their grip on power is, given they are often accused of charges similar to what Bangladeshi, Sri Lankan and Nepali protesters said of their leaders, that the government is indifferent to all but themselves and is highly authoritarian,” London-based Hassan said. But the Kathmandu-based human rights activist who requested anonymity said that from Nepal’s perspective, Pakistan would likely not be a priority for the next leader – whoever it is. “Nepal has friendly relations with Pakistan, but unlike India or China, Pakistan relations are not seen as a factor in Nepali domestic politics, nor do Nepali governments have distinctive policies towards Pakistan,” he said.",0.036679466623911,0.3250421142643366,neutral,"{'neg': 0.13, 'neu': 0.801, 'pos': 0.069, 'compound': -0.999}",negative

Nepali Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has been forced to step down after a wave of anticorruption protests left 19 people dead and more than 100 injured, but tens of thousands of protesters remained on the streets, blocking roads and setting fires to parliament and other government buildings.

“In view of the adverse situation in the country, I have resigned effective today to facilitate the solution to the problem and to help resolve it politically in accordance with the constitution,” Oli wrote in his letter to President Ramchandra Paudel on Tuesday after his administration was blamed for the bloodiest outbreaks of unrest in a decade.

Defying an indefinite curfew, thousands of young Nepalis returned to the streets of Kathmandu on Tuesday, demanding change and clashing with riot police. Some protesters set fire to government buildings.

The demonstrations – called the protest of Gen Z – erupted after the government blocked platforms, including Facebook, X and YouTube, saying the companies had failed to register and submit to government oversight.

But the protests spiralled to reflect broader discontent. In particular, many young people are angry that the children of political leaders – so-called “nepo kids” – seem to enjoy luxury lifestyles and numerous advantages while most youth struggle to find work.

On Tuesday, despite the government rolling back its order and the apps returning online, protests reignited, spreading from the capital to multiple cities nationwide.

“The Nepal government has fallen, the youth have won the protest,” said key protest figure Sudan Gurung, in a post on newly restored Instagram. “The future is ours.”

President Ram Chandra Poudel, the ceremonial head of state, appealed to the protesters to engage in discussions to find a peaceful resolution and stop further escalation.

In a video message, Nepalese army chief Ashok Raj Sigdel urged protesters to stop the demonstrations to prevent further loss of lives and property and to come forward for dialogue.

Nepal’s struggle with weak governance

The upheaval is the most serious since 2008, when street demonstrations brought down Nepal’s centuries-old monarchy.

Despite democratic reforms, the Himalayan nation of 30 million has struggled with weak governance and endemic corruption. Economic opportunities remain scarce, forcing millions of Nepalis to seek work abroad in Gulf states, South Korea and Malaysia, sending money home to sustain their families.

With youth unemployment running at about 20 percent last year, according to the World Bank, the government estimates that more than 2,000 young people leave the country every day to seek work in the Middle East or Southeast Asia.

Oli, 73, had been in office for his fourth term since July last year, becoming the 14th prime minister in the post-monarchy era. Two cabinet ministers resigned late on Monday, citing “moral grounds.”

Witnesses said protesters torched tyres, hurled stones, and set fire to the homes of several politicians.

Local media reported that military helicopters evacuated ministers from besieged houses. Crowds also ransacked the prime minister’s residence and set alight the Singha Durbar government complex, which includes parliament and key ministries.

Footage circulating on social media showed former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and his wife, along with Foreign Minister Arzu Rana and Finance Minister Bishnu Paudel, being attacked by demonstrators before soldiers intervened.

The United Nations rights chief, Volker Turk, said he was “appalled” by the violence and called for talks.

Those appeals did not seem to be heeded.

Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said the headquarters of a major publisher – the Kantipur Media Group – was burning, and called on “protesters not to target journalists”.

https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/09/nepal-gen-z-topple-government?lang=en,Don’t Panic Yet Over AI Chip Sales to China,"U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to sell advanced AI chips, including Nvidia’s H200, to China has sent Washington’s hawks scrambling. Former State Department official Chris McGuire described the move as “a transformational moment for U.S. technology policy.” China’s strengths in engineering and electricity generation make the choice to export American hardware “possibly decisive in the AI race,” warned Rush Doshi, a former National Security Council China hand.

Selling H200s is, indeed, a sharp break in U.S. strategy, but how consequential the move will be depends on what the administration does next. The more important decision—and one that the administration has seemingly yet to make—is how many of the chips to sell. If the Trump team allows China to buy millions, it will risk upending the AI race. But if it limits the numbers, and uses each shipment as leverage, the effects will be far less dramatic.

Taking the latter course would mean repeating the strategy the administration has adopted in AI sales to the Middle East—a big announcement followed by a slow drip of exports. If it does that, Washington may manage to boost Nvidia’s market share in China without conceding America’s overall compute advantage. Of course, selling any number of H200s will bring risks, including alienating crucial allies, and Trump seems to have made his announcement without winning anything from China in return. But as so often with Trump, the reality may be less dramatic than the immediate fireworks suggest.

The Coveted H200

Released in March 2024, the H200 is Nvidia’s flagship product from its Hopper generation of chips. Although Hopper chips have been overtaken by Nvidia’s newest offering, the Blackwell line, the H200 is still widely used in AI training and inference. Most of the world’s largest clusters of AI chips depend on the H200 and its predecessor, the H100. Despite its age, the H200 is still some 30 percent more powerful than the best Chinese chip, Huawei’s Ascend 910C.

Nor is China about to close the compute gap anytime soon. Huawei, China’s top chip designer, predicts it will not produce a chip that matches the H200 until late 2027, nor can it match Nvidia’s production volume. According to public estimates, in 2025, U.S. firms will produce at least twenty times as many chips (adjusted for performance) as Chinese producers, and in 2026 they will produce at least fifty times as many.

Selling H200 chips, therefore, will give China’s AI ambitions a real boost. Even without easy access to American chips, Chinese developers are producing powerful AI models and capturing growing market shares. Those same developers consistently say that their inability to buy enough AI chips is the main thing holding them back from even faster progress. Already, big Chinese tech companies, including Alibaba and Tencent, are reportedly pushing the government for access to future H200 imports.

That, of course, is the Trump team’s hope. They argue that Nvidia will pull demand from Chinese chipmakers, starving them of the revenue and research and development feedback loops they need to improve their products and win more customers around the world. Yet China is determined to build a domestic AI supply chain, and its indigenization strategy long predates U.S. restrictions on the sale of AI chips. Already, the Chinese government has signaled that it will force customers to keep using Huawei products, with foreign offerings filling in what Chinese companies cannot produce.

No wonder, then, that many see danger for the U.S. AI industry. “This decision is nuts,” former national security adviser Jake Sullivan told the New York Times. “We are literally handing away our advantage. China’s leaders can’t believe their luck.” What’s more, Trump doesn’t seem to have received anything from China in return. At his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in October, Trump won a trade truce without offering up American chips. There is little strategic logic in waiting six weeks only to hand them over anyway.

A Trickle, Not a Flood

As strategically baffling as the move may be, it doesn’t necessarily spell the end for American AI dominance. That’s because which chips China can buy matters far less than how many of them it can amass—and the Trump administration still has time to decide how many to sell.

Quantity matters because modern AI is incredibly hungry for computing power. A large installed base of AI chips is essential for training major new models—the biggest models now use tens or hundreds of thousands of the latest chips. It’s also needed to serve customers and to research new architectures and training methods. (In 2024, OpenAI used the majority of its compute for research, not for training or inferencing public models.) A national advantage in computing power has compounding returns: More chips mean better AI products, better products mean more revenue, and more revenue should mean more funds to reinvest in research and development.

What really matters is whether the United States sells China a few hundred thousand H200-class chips—or several million. The Institute for Progress reckons that without any restrictions on exports, China would likely buy more than 2 million chips over the next year. This would shrink the U.S. advantage in installed AI compute from more than 10x to between 1.2x and 5x, and it could help Chinese AI companies leapfrog U.S. competitors. If, on the other hand, the administration approves only a couple hundred thousand chips, it will give the Chinese companies that buy them a shot in the arm, but the United States would likely retain a heavy compute advantage.

There are signs that the administration may not be planning a free-for-all. For starters, Trump’s announcement claimed that chips would be sold only to “approved” customers under “conditions” that would protect national security. Who exactly those customers are matters little, as the U.S. government will struggle to stop chips changing hands inside China, but Trump’s statement suggests that the United States will grant licenses to individual buyers, not remove the restriction on exports entirely.

Keeping the license requirement means the administration will retain the ability to control the volume of sales. Under the export control laws, the Commerce Department can specify how many chips a license covers, when the authorization expires, and any other conditions it chooses. Officials can also revoke a license with the stroke of a pen. Rather than signing off on large quantities right away, Commerce could hold back each approval until Beijing shows progress on one of the Trump administration’s other goals, such as rare earth shipments or trade cooperation.

The Trump administration has already used this “big announcement, slow follow-up” tactic with AI chip sales in the Middle East. In May, during his visit to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, Trump promised vast chip partnerships totaling millions of advanced Nvidia processors. Yet it took six months for the first approvals for shipments to Saudi and Emirati firms to emerge, and even then, the Commerce Department signed off on just 35,000 of the latest Nvidia chips, far less than was originally promised. The delay reportedly came because Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick pushed Emirati leaders to follow through on their promises of investment in the United States before signing off on exports. National security concerns also reportedly held things up.

Something similar may well happen with H200 shipments to China. White House and Commerce Department officials will have to negotiate license conditions with Nvidia, Chinese buyers, and perhaps the Chinese government. Four agencies—Commerce, State, Energy, and Defense—get to weigh in on license approvals. Every new Chinese provocation will provide a reason to pause shipments. Pressure from Congress may also slow things down.

On the Chinese side, there will be plenty of willing buyers, but there are already signs of friction from the government. The day after Trump’s announcement, the Financial Times reported that the Ministry of State Security is considering asking potential buyers to explain why they cannot fulfill their needs with Huawei products. Many Chinese companies will win approval—Beijing has asked for these chips for years—but the Chinese government will want to ensure continued demand for Huawei chips and pressure for indigenization. That, too, could cause delays.

Even some of the chips that do flow will simply displace China’s existing access to Nvidia processors. China already has a large stockpile, in part from imports before the United States tightened export control rules in October 2023, and many more chips are smuggled into the country every year. In addition, some Chinese companies reportedly have been able to access banned chips through large data centers in nearby countries such as Malaysia, which have seen surges in imports over the past year. If H200 sales end up in the low hundreds of thousands, many of them will likely replace chips that Chinese developers would have smuggled or accessed remotely anyway.

Alienating Allies

Trump’s decision still has huge strategic significance. For one thing, it will make it far harder for the United States to persuade other countries to impose their own restrictions on the sale of AI technology to China. For years, Washington has pressured allies—including Japan, the Netherlands, and Taiwan—to accept economic pain and diplomatic tensions with Beijing based on American assurances that technology restrictions are vital to their collective national security. If the United States now concludes that selling advanced AI chips to China serves American interests, those allies may question why they should bear the costs of enforcing complementary restrictions.

That is particularly unfortunate, as any coherent strategy to defend the U.S. advantage in chip production depends on allied cooperation. If the Trump administration wants to hold back Chinese chipmakers by letting Nvidia poach their customers, that tactic will work best if it is paired with tougher restrictions on the sale of chipmaking equipment to Chinese companies. A good place to start is the House China Select Committee’s recommendation to bar all sales of deep ultraviolet immersion lithography machines. These machines, which are currently blocked only to a subset of Chinese companies, are a key choke point in the production of advanced chips. They are, however, produced by the Dutch company ASML, whose government may well be skeptical of imposing new restrictions at the request of a U.S. administration with an inconsistent China policy and an apparent hostility to the European project.",https://carnegieendowment.org/emissary/2025/12/china-ai-chip-sales-nvidia-trump?lang=en,,"U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to sell advanced AI chips, including Nvidia’s H200, to China has sent Washington’s hawks scrambling.

For years, Washington has pressured allies—including Japan, the Netherlands, and Taiwan—to accept economic pain and diplomatic tensions with Beijing based on American assurances that technology restrictions are vital to their collective national security. If the United States now concludes that selling advanced AI chips to China serves American interests, those allies may question why they should bear the costs of enforcing complementary restrictions. That is particularly unfortunate, as any coherent strategy to defend the U.S. advantage in chip production depends on allied cooperation. If the Trump administration wants to hold back Chinese chipmakers by letting Nvidia poach their customers, that tactic will work best if it is paired with tougher restrictions on the sale of chipmaking equipment to Chinese companies. A good place to start is the House China Select Committee’s recommendation to bar all sales of deep ultraviolet immersion lithography machines. These machines, which are currently blocked only to a subset of Chinese companies, are a key choke point in the production of advanced chips. They are, however, produced by the Dutch company ASML, whose government may well be skeptical of imposing new restrictions at the request of a U.S. administration with an inconsistent China policy and an apparent hostility to the European project.",0.1082796066084836,0.405046839672508,positive,"{'neg': 0.051, 'neu': 0.819, 'pos': 0.13, 'compound': 0.9993}",positive
https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/09/nepal-gen-z-topple-government?lang=en,"If Trump Wants to Meet Kim Again, He’s Got One Big Opportunity in Early 2026","In the lead-up to President Donald J. Trump’s trip to South Korea last month, speculation mounted about the possibility of yet another summit between him and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. During Trump’s first term, the two men met three times, including the president’s historic steps onto North Korean soil in June 2019. Subsequently, North Korea rejected wholesale further talks with Washington and dramatically accelerated the growth and refinement of its nuclear weapons programs while sealing in a new alliance with Russia.

In his second term, Trump has periodically talked up the prospect of engagement with North Korea. He has described the country as a “big nuclear nation”—much to the chagrin of U.S. allies in Northeast Asia—and underscored his “very good relationship” with Kim. Earlier this year, he suggested he would “probably do something with him at some point.” While in South Korea, Trump brushed off a cruise missile test by Pyongyang and said that “we’ll come back and we’ll, at some point in the not too distant future, meet with North Korea.”

The president’s instincts to seek engagement with North Korea provide an important opportunity for the United States, which faces a challenging global nuclear environment amid difficult relations with both Russia and China. The unbounded nature of North Korea’s nuclear and conventional military programs, the deepening alliance between Moscow and Pyongyang, and the intensifying risks of clashes between the two Koreas all create strong reasons for engagement.

Although Trump and his advisers have been unable to generate a pathway to engagement with North Korea in their first eleven months in office, the start of the coming year may present the best opportunity for a new U.S. push. In addition, Kim’s position on negotiations with the United States has hardened considerably since the failures of Trump’s first term, but recent indicators suggest that a sliver of opportunity remains. But to create momentum, Trump must formulate a policy line that will make it easier for Kim to affirm interest in talks.

From ‘Denuclearization’ to ‘Coexistence’

In May, my colleague Frank Aum and I argued in a Carnegie paper reviewing U.S. North Korea policy that in the near term Washington should adopt a “stable coexistence” framework. This framework would emphasize the prevention of conventional and nuclear conflict on the Korean Peninsula as the primary U.S. strategic interest—supplanting denuclearization, as such—and affirm the lack of any intention to seek the end of North Korea’s regime.

A little more than one month later, South Korean President Lee Jae-myung, in his inaugural address, proffered a similar idea. Lee advocated for “peaceful coexistence” with North Korea, borrowing a term with conceptual origins in the Soviet Union. In September, following repeated invocations of the “coexistence” framing, North Korean state media reported that Kim himself had indicated an openness to this concept—though not in the context of seeking diplomacy with South Korea, but with the United States.

“If the United States, freeing itself from its absurd pursuit of other’s denuclearization and recognizing the reality, wants genuine peaceful coexistence with us, there is no reason for us not to come face to face with it,” Kim told the Supreme People’s Assembly, North Korea’s state legislature, in September. Kim also appeared to reciprocate Trump’s positive framing toward him: “Personally, I still have a good memory of the current U.S. President Trump.”

Despite these bromides and the momentum around a framing of “coexistence,” the reflexive instincts in both the U.S. and ROK governments again revealed the challenges of authoring a major shift in policy. On November 13, the United States and South Korea released a joint fact sheet that covered all outcomes from Trump’s October 29 state visit to South Korea. That document, with no allusions to “coexistence” at all, outlined a policy of seeking the “complete denuclearization of the DPRK,” and the implementation of the “Joint Statement of the 2018 U.S.-DPRK Singapore Summit.”

At no point in its history has North Korea endorsed any documents or agreements seeking the “denuclearization of the DPRK.” From 1991 until 2018, it had periodically endorsed a broader framing of “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” which is the language that appears in the text of the Singapore joint statement. The distinction between these two terms has drawn ire from North Korea repeatedly in the past. Careful to recognize the term’s historical underpinnings, the United States and South Korea previously have been careful to use the “Korean Peninsula” framing. But they appeared to shift during the previous administrations in both Washington and Seoul—the reasons for which were never publicized, but likely were due to former president Yoon Suk Yeol’s harder-line policies toward Pyongyang.

Not surprisingly, on November 18, North Korea’s Korean Central News Agency released a commentary—an authoritative statement—on the joint fact sheet, describing it as a “confrontational declaration.” The commentary observed:

The U.S. and the ROK rulers have replaced the words of the “complete denuclearization on the Korean peninsula” which they touted for mere form’s sake in the past with the ones of the “complete denuclearization of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea”. It is the unanimous assessment of the international community that it is neither more or less than denying the entity and the existence of the DPRK.

For North Korea and Kim himself, the objectives of denuclearization—be it of North Korea or the broader Korean Peninsula—and coexistence are mutually exclusive goals. The allusion to the denial of the “existence of the DPRK” is consistent with Kim’s post-2021 hardening stance on the centrality of nuclear arms to the survival of his regime and the state. Where North Korea, in the past, remained willing to contemplate denuclearization conditioned on changes to an ever-shifting set of U.S. “hostile policies,” Kim has categorically refused the prospect in recent years. Simply put, if Washington and Seoul continue to prioritize denuclearization of any sort, there is virtually no chance that Kim will see potential value in talks.

Notably, Trump himself has not once endorsed North Korean denuclearization in any remarks since his inauguration earlier this year. If the president and his advisers continue to retain an interest in engagement with North Korea, here lies a critical opportunity.

The Opportunities in Early 2026

The U.S. and North Korean political calendars align briefly early next year, presenting a rare opening for engagement. On Pyongyang’s side, the Workers’ Party of Korea will convene a Party Congress—the apex political event in its calendar—likely in February. Kim is expected to make a series of prominent announcements on domestic and foreign priorities. He has already alluded, for instance, to new announcements on the modernization of his conventional and nuclear forces.

If the past is any guide, Kim may reiterate his September 2025 position on engagement around a “coexistence” framing. Although the United States has limited influence over Kim’s choices, Trump could seize the important opportunity to make it easier for Kim to say yes to the prospect of renewed negotiations.

In off-the-cuff remarks primarily to journalists, Trump has repeatedly indicated an interest in meeting Kim, but he has yet to do so in a way that indicates a meaningful shift in U.S. policy. Indeed, the administration failed to mention Pyongyang even once in its National Security Strategy released last week. With that opportunity now forgone, a formal, highly visible speech would be the next most ideal format, and the 2026 State of the Union Address may be the most suitable near-term forum to persuade Kim that the relationship can be reset.

Although State of the Union addresses are traditionally focused on domestic affairs, past presidents have used them to great effect on foreign affairs—from President James Monroe’s 1823 statement of what would come to be known as the Monroe Doctrine to President George W. Bush’s fateful 2002 declaration of an Axis of Evil (which included North Korea). North Korea’s willingness to take up Trump’s informal remarks indicating an interest in Kim appears to be limited, but a prepared State of the Union speech that contains a formal statement of a new desired end-state for U.S.-North Korea relations—one ideally adopting a coexistence framing—could create an opening. Kim may not accept the proposition, but the U.S. goal should be to kick-start momentum on engagement in 2026. Indeed, a highly public reframing of U.S. policy may convey greater credibility to North Korea than new letters, which the administration has sought to deliver to Kim to no apparent success.

Any shift of this magnitude in U.S. policy has implications for U.S. allies in the region. The Trump administration should consult with both South Korea and Japan before unveiling a new framework for relations with North Korea. For Seoul and Tokyo, a key concern will be the possible abandonment of denuclearization as a formal goal and the implicit conferment of nuclear status on North Korea. As I have argued before in these pages, the status question is a red herring in many ways and should not hamstring policy changes that can shift momentum toward risk reduction. The administration would be wise to keep denuclearization as a private, long-term aspiration but omit it from declaratory policy statements, since it currently inhibits any engagement with North Korea. Washington will likely need to persuade its allies that these steps will, on balance, improve the regional security environment if they foster durable engagement.",https://carnegieendowment.org/emissary/2025/12/trump-kim-north-korea-meeting-formal-outreach-sotu?lang=en,,"In the lead-up to President Donald J.

https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/09/nepal-gen-z-topple-government?lang=en,Have Top Chinese AI Researchers Stayed in the United States?,"Researchers from China have long been one of the largest contributors to cutting-edge artificial intelligence research at American companies and universities. Studies of the top AI research papers have shown the authors originally from China contributing as much—if not more—to American AI output than authors from the United States.

But the past seven years of escalating U.S.-China tensions have raised a new question: Are these U.S.-based Chinese AI researchers now returning to China en masse? Put more sharply, is the United States training researchers who will go on to build the AI capabilities of its top geopolitical rival?

To answer that question, we leveraged and updated a unique dataset from a 2020 study by the Paulson Institute: The Global AI Talent Tracker. (Matt Sheehan was one of the authors of that study.) That dataset contained a sample of 675 top-tier AI researchers who had their research papers accepted at perhaps the world’s top AI conference, NeurIPS 2019 (which has an acceptance rate of about 20 percent). The data showed where these researchers had completed their undergraduate degrees (a rough proxy for country of origin), where they went to graduate school, and where they worked at the time. Within that sample of 675 researchers, exactly 100 of them were Chinese-origin researchers doing research at U.S. institutions as of 2019. To assess whether the United States has retained this pool of top AI talent, we recently gathered updated information on where those 100 researchers work today.

Eighty-seven of them remain at U.S. institutions. Only ten left to work for Chinese companies or universities, with the remaining three affiliated with institutions in other countries.

This is good—and perhaps surprising—news for U.S. AI competitiveness. Historically, Chinese researchers who came to the United States for their PhDs have had very high stay-rates, with around 90 percent remaining in the country long term. But amid mounting U.S.-China tensions over the past five years, studies have documented a sharp rise in the number of Chinese-origin researchers, across many disciplines, who chose to leave the United States and return to China. Set against this backdrop, our data on Chinese-origin AI researchers showcases the enduring attractiveness of the United States as a place to work at the frontiers of AI.

But reasons for concern remain. Although the data shows America’s ability to retain top AI researchers who are already here, there are some signs that America’s ability to attract Chinese talent is waning. Though this data is limited, it appears that a larger share of talented Chinese AI researchers are simply choosing to remain in China rather than come to America in the first place.

Obstacles to Staying, Reasons for Leaving

In recent years, a number of high-profile, Chinese-born AI researchers have made a splash when they decided to leave the United States and return to China. The reasons why any individual researcher returns home are varied and often personal. But the recent geopolitical tumult has created new obstacles and pressures for Chinese researchers who want to remain in the United States.

Beginning in 2018, a series of actual and proposed restrictions on student visas—including discussions of an all-out ban on Chinese students—left many Chinese researchers in limbo. Chinese applicants faced long delays in processing visa renewals, making them uncertain whether they would be able to finish their degrees and remain in the United States to work. Many who did stay said they felt a cloud of suspicion cast on their work by U.S.-China technological tensions and accusations of industrial espionage.

A series of high-profile indictments of Chinese researchers in the United States sent chills through these communities, but many of those cases collapsed upon further investigation. In a 2021 survey of university researchers who self-identify as Chinese, 42 percent reported feeling racially profiled by the U.S. government. In conversations with Chinese engineers and researchers during this time, several described instances in which U.S. customs officials confiscated and searched the electronic devices of them or their friends and colleagues.

Travel restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic further curbed incentives and opportunities for Chinese researchers coming or returning to the United States. In February 2020, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump barred entry for foreign nationals who had been in China within the previous two weeks, and China followed up with its own restrictions on inbound travel in March. Even after China officially reopened its borders in 2023, flights between the two countries remained scarce, with daily flights still less than 30 percent of the pre-pandemic levels today.

In addition to these obstacles to remaining in the U.S., China’s AI industry is also exerting a stronger pull on researchers who have gone overseas. Just five or ten years ago, if someone wanted to work at the global forefront of AI research, the opportunities to do that in China were quite limited. But today, Chinese companies and universities have rapidly caught up in pathbreaking research and the training of frontier AI models, giving these researchers the chance to do this work without moving halfway across the world and operating in a second language.

Who Stayed and Who Left

Despite these new push-and-pull factors, the vast majority of researchers from the dataset chose to continue working for U.S. institutions six years later. During the intervening years, many of them moved from U.S. universities into the private sector.

Of these eighty-seven people, forty-one of them currently work in U.S. companies, forty hold professorships at U.S. universities, and six are either completing doctoral degrees or in postdoctoral research positions. Of those working for U.S. companies, more than half are employed by the Magnificent Seven (Google, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla), with others lending their talents to some of the top American AI startups. Three of the eighty-seven founded their own startups in the United States.

Although only ten out of the 100 researchers returned to work for Chinese institutions, those who did return tended to be very high-impact. Two founded their own startups, two took on leadership roles in AI-focused tech giants, and five became professors at some of China’s top universities.

One of the returnees is Yang Zhilin, a star researcher who completed his undergraduate degree at Tsinghua University in 2015 before heading to Carnegie Mellon University for his PhD in computer science. At Carnegie Mellon, Yang was the lead author on widely cited research papers co-authored with some of the world’s most influential AI researchers. In 2023, Yang returned to China to found Moonshot AI, a company whose Chinese name (Dark Side of the Moon) is an homage to Yang’s favorite album. Moonshot has since raised more than a billion dollars and released the Kimi model series, producing some of the world’s top-performing open-source (OS) models. Many U.S. startups are now adopting and building on top of Kimi and other Chinese OS models such as Alibaba’s Qwen. In explaining the decision, they often cite a combination of performance and cost-efficiency in Chinese models that aren’t available from the closed, proprietary models released by American firms such as OpenAI and Anthropic.

Yang’s path highlights the ways in which—despite intense geopolitical rivalry—the Chinese and American AI research communities remain deeply intertwined, connected through rich cross-border flows of people, ideas, and now leading AI models.

Missing the Next Generation

Although the United States has managed to retain a large portion of Chinese AI researchers over the past six years, there are signs that it has lost some of its ability to attract new arrivals from China—a potentially ominous trend given China’s share of global AI talent.

The original Global AI Talent Tracker drew its data from researchers whose papers were accepted at NeurIPS 2019. At the time, Chinese-origin researchers made up 29 percent of the authors of papers at the conference, surpassing the U.S. share of 20 percent and Europe’s 17 percent. Fortunately for the United States, the majority of those Chinese-origin authors (as well as researchers from around the world) chose to do their research at U.S. institutions. Looking at the 2019 affiliation of these 675 top-tier researchers, 59 percent worked at U.S. institutions, compared with 11 percent for China, and 10 percent for Europe. Of the researchers who completed undergrad in China, 56 percent were studying or working for U.S. institutions, compared to 37 percent in Chinese institutions. Looking at all of the researchers who were working at U.S. institutions, 31 percent had completed undergrad in the United States, followed by 27 percent in China, and 11 percent in Europe and India respectively.

Three years later, the Paulson Institute re-ran the study using authors of papers at NeurIPS 2022. By that point, Chinese-origin researchers made up nearly half of all the authors sampled, and Chinese institutions had more than doubled their share to 28 percent. That was still well short of the U.S. share of 42 percent, but it demonstrated rapid catch-up by China in producing many of the year’s best AI research papers.

It also suggested that a larger share of these top-tier Chinese researchers were choosing to remain in China instead of coming to the United States. The 2022 study doesn’t provide numbers on what percentage of these researchers who attended undergrad in China remained in the country for graduate school and to work, but it notes that more Chinese-origin researchers were choosing to stay in China.

If left unchanged, these trends—a larger share of top-tier researchers originating from China, and a smaller portion of those researchers coming to the United States—don’t bode well for U.S. competitiveness. Over several decades, the United States has accumulated a huge number of elite researchers who came from China but chose to live and work in the United States long term. If that flow of talent stops—or even worse, is reversed—the United States will be left scrambling to try to train and attract enough talented researchers to fill the void.

An “All of the Above” Strategy

The United States maintains many advantages when it comes to building and deploying the world’s most advanced and most productive AI systems. It has a major edge over China in access to the cutting-edge chips used to train and run AI systems. Despite the rapid rise of some Chinese apps, American tech giants such as Google and Meta have far larger and more diverse global user bases, giving them inroads into markets and insights into users that their Chinese peers lack. But one of the strongest long-term advantages of the U.S. AI ecosystem—the world’s best pool of research and engineering talent—is at risk.",https://carnegieendowment.org/emissary/2025/12/china-ai-researchers-us-talent-pool?lang=en,,"Researchers from China have long been one of the largest contributors to cutting-edge artificial intelligence research at American companies and universities.

Even after China officially reopened its borders in 2023, flights between the two countries remained scarce, with daily flights still less than 30 percent of the pre-pandemic levels today. In addition to these obstacles to remaining in the U.S., China’s AI industry is also exerting a stronger pull on researchers who have gone overseas. Just five or ten years ago, if someone wanted to work at the global forefront of AI research, the opportunities to do that in China were quite limited. But today, Chinese companies and universities have rapidly caught up in pathbreaking research and the training of frontier AI models, giving these researchers the chance to do this work without moving halfway across the world and operating in a second language. Who Stayed and Who Left Despite these new push-and-pull factors, the vast majority of researchers from the dataset chose to continue working for U.S. institutions six years later. During the intervening years, many of them moved from U.S. universities into the private sector. Of these eighty-seven people, forty-one of them currently work in U.S. companies, forty hold professorships at U.S. universities, and six are either completing doctoral degrees or in postdoctoral research positions. Of those working for U.S. companies, more than half are employed by the Magnificent Seven (Google, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla), with others lending their talents to some of the top American AI startups. Three of the eighty-seven founded their own startups in the United States. Although only ten out of the 100 researchers returned to work for Chinese institutions, those who did return tended to be very high-impact. Two founded their own startups, two took on leadership roles in AI-focused tech giants, and five became professors at some of China’s top universities. One of the returnees is Yang Zhilin, a star researcher who completed his undergraduate degree at Tsinghua University in 2015 before heading to Carnegie Mellon University for his PhD in computer science. At Carnegie Mellon, Yang was the lead author on widely cited research papers co-authored with some of the world’s most influential AI researchers. In 2023, Yang returned to China to found Moonshot AI, a company whose Chinese name (Dark Side of the Moon) is an homage to Yang’s favorite album. Moonshot has since raised more than a billion dollars and released the Kimi model series, producing some of the world’s top-performing open-source (OS) models. Many U.S. startups are now adopting and building on top of Kimi and other Chinese OS models such as Alibaba’s Qwen. In explaining the decision, they often cite a combination of performance and cost-efficiency in Chinese models that aren’t available from the closed, proprietary models released by American firms such as OpenAI and Anthropic. Yang’s path highlights the ways in which—despite intense geopolitical rivalry—the Chinese and American AI research communities remain deeply intertwined, connected through rich cross-border flows of people, ideas, and now leading AI models. Missing the Next Generation Although the United States has managed to retain a large portion of Chinese AI researchers over the past six years, there are signs that it has lost some of its ability to attract new arrivals from China—a potentially ominous trend given China’s share of global AI talent. The original Global AI Talent Tracker drew its data from researchers whose papers were accepted at NeurIPS 2019. At the time, Chinese-origin researchers made up 29 percent of the authors of papers at the conference, surpassing the U.S. share of 20 percent and Europe’s 17 percent. Fortunately for the United States, the majority of those Chinese-origin authors (as well as researchers from around the world) chose to do their research at U.S. institutions. Looking at the 2019 affiliation of these 675 top-tier researchers, 59 percent worked at U.S. institutions, compared with 11 percent for China, and 10 percent for Europe. Of the researchers who completed undergrad in China, 56 percent were studying or working for U.S. institutions, compared to 37 percent in Chinese institutions. Looking at all of the researchers who were working at U.S. institutions, 31 percent had completed undergrad in the United States, followed by 27 percent in China, and 11 percent in Europe and India respectively. Three years later, the Paulson Institute re-ran the study using authors of papers at NeurIPS 2022. By that point, Chinese-origin researchers made up nearly half of all the authors sampled, and Chinese institutions had more than doubled their share to 28 percent. That was still well short of the U.S. share of 42 percent, but it demonstrated rapid catch-up by China in producing many of the year’s best AI research papers. It also suggested that a larger share of these top-tier Chinese researchers were choosing to remain in China instead of coming to the United States. The 2022 study doesn’t provide numbers on what percentage of these researchers who attended undergrad in China remained in the country for graduate school and to work, but it notes that more Chinese-origin researchers were choosing to stay in China. If left unchanged, these trends—a larger share of top-tier researchers originating from China, and a smaller portion of those researchers coming to the United States—don’t bode well for U.S. competitiveness. Over several decades, the United States has accumulated a huge number of elite researchers who came from China but chose to live and work in the United States long term. If that flow of talent stops—or even worse, is reversed—the United States will be left scrambling to try to train and attract enough talented researchers to fill the void. An “All of the Above” Strategy The United States maintains many advantages when it comes to building and deploying the world’s most advanced and most productive AI systems. It has a major edge over China in access to the cutting-edge chips used to train and run AI systems. Despite the rapid rise of some Chinese apps, American tech giants such as Google and Meta have far larger and more diverse global user bases, giving them inroads into markets and insights into users that their Chinese peers lack. But one of the strongest long-term advantages of the U.S. AI ecosystem—the world’s best pool of research and engineering talent—is at risk.",0.1282844449788894,0.3383741382074715,positive,"{'neg': 0.035, 'neu': 0.821, 'pos': 0.144, 'compound': 0.9997}",positive

New demonstrations emerged in more than seventy countries. Of those catalogued in Carnegie’s Global Protest Tracker, twenty-seven occurred in countries ranked “partly free” with respect to people’s access to political rights and civil liberties, twenty-six “free,” and seventeen “not free.” Anger against government corruption fueled a sizeable portion of the protests catalogued in the Global Protest Tracker this year. The two other main triggers were antidemocratic overreach and economic hardship.

Specific corruption scandals or allegations sparked demonstrations in multiple regions. In March, North Macedonia erupted in protests condemning the alleged corruption and bribery that led to a deadly nightclub fire. Over 45,000 people in Spain took to the streets to criticize Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez for the various political and corruption scandals surrounding his administration. The persistent issue of corruption in the Gambia brought out protesters who demanded government accountability. The Gen-Z protests in Nepal, which garnered significant media attention, were also spurred by issues of nepotism and corruption, and eventually led to Prime Minister K. P. Sharma Oli’s resignation. Around the same time, the Philippines saw Gen-Z protests against a corruption scandal involving the country’s flood control projects.

Other corruption-related protests were triggered less by specific scandals or allegations and more by simmering underlying public anger over corruption and other forms of government malfeasance. Mongolia’s protests in May initially emerged to condemn the lavish spending of the son of Prime Minister Luvsannamsrain Oyun-Erdene, but they developed into a broader anti-corruption movement that ousted Oyun-Erdene. In Indonesia, Gen-Z protests against parliament members’ high salaries were partially driven by longstanding anger toward perceived government corruption. Morocco’s Gen-Z protests were similarly fueled by anger over corruption, though they initially stemmed from Moroccans’ frustration over inappropriate government spending and the neglect of government services. In Mexico, the death of Uruapan Mayor Carlos Alberto Manzo triggered nationwide demonstrations against corruption and violent crime. The ongoing protests in Serbia, which began in November 2024 over the Novi Sad train station roof collapse, evolved into anti-corruption protests and general protests against the government of President Aleksandar Vučić.

Antidemocratic overreach by governments, a major theme of protests in 2024, continued driving demonstrations this year. Fury over broad governmental claims to expanding power triggered many protests. In Indonesia, students and pro-democracy activists protested revisions to the nation’s military law, which permitted military officers to serve in civilian government posts and thus widened the military’s role in civilian affairs. Central African Republic President Faustin-Archange Touadéra’s bid for a third term in upcoming elections mobilized thousands who opposed his extended rule. Mali experienced protests after the military junta extended its rule for another five years and dissolved all political parties. The removal of presidential term limits in Togo triggered deadly protests, led by Gen-Z and other activists angered by Faure Gnassingbé’s extended rule and concerned over the state of democracy in the country. In Ukraine, thousands took to the streets over a law that they feared would undermine the independence of anti-corruption agencies by placing them under the supervision of the presidentially appointed prosecutor general. Brazil’s “shielding” bill, which provided greater immunity to lawmakers, also prompted enraged citizens to demonstrate against its passage. The United States experienced multiple protests throughout the year against the perceived authoritarian actions of President Donald Trump and his administration.

Governmental targeting of political opposition or civil society also pushed citizens to the streets in various places. Anger over attacks on internal dissenters or opposition figures triggered protests in Israel over the dismissal of Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar, in Ivory Coast over the ban of opposition candidates in the 2025 presidential election, and in Türkiye over the arrests of various opposition figures (which have been ongoing since 2024). Threats to civil rights and liberties prompted numerous demonstrations, such as those in Slovakia criticizing an NGO bill that held similarities to Russia’s foreign agent law, in the United Kingdom decrying a Supreme Court ruling against transgender rights, and in Hungary denouncing the ban against Pride demonstrations and criticizing a foreign funding bill that also resembled Russia’s foreign agent law.

Economic hardship also drove many demonstrations in 2025. Several countries experienced protests over unpopular austerity measures, including Belgium, Indonesia, France, Slovakia, Romania, and Argentina. Frustrated by the ongoing economic struggles in their countries, demonstrators argued that the various reforms—which impacted pensions, education, and worker benefits—would only worsen the existing hardships. Demonstrators in other countries protested generally against high costs of living. In Greece and Chile, workers demanded greater protections and benefits from the government. In Angola and Ecuador, increased fuel prices drove hundreds to thousands of disgruntled protestors to the streets. Spain’s high rent prices, exacerbated by the region’s tourism boom, triggered massive protests from aggrieved residents who demanded government action in increasing affordable housing.

Some protests that began in 2024 sustained their momentum throughout 2025. The anti-corruption protests in Serbia and the election- and EU accession-related protests in Georgia have occurred almost daily since their emergence last year. Other protests, such as those in Türkiye against the arrest of opposition figures, in France and Belgium involving farmers and the EU-Mercosur trade agreement, and in Israel against ultra-Orthodox conscription, continued intermittently throughout 2025 in response to major government actions. Protests against the Israeli government regarding the war in Gaza also continued to erupt every month across the globe, from Italy and Morocco to Malaysia and Australia.",https://carnegieendowment.org/emissary/2025/12/global-protests-2025-genz-corruption-economy?lang=en,,"Anti-government protests flooded streets across the globe in 2025, from Sub-Saharan Africa to Eastern Europe to Southeast Asia.

https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/09/nepal-gen-z-topple-government?lang=en,The New Democracy Defenders,"As U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration have dismantled international democracy support over the past ten months—gutting aid programs, withdrawing from multilateral agreements, and transforming the U.S. from a standard-bearer of global democracy into a case study in democratic backsliding—world democracies have struggled to formulate a collective response. Reports have been authored, statements issued, and joint letters signed—but real action remains limited. Of these efforts, the most organized so far is In Defense of Democracy: Fighting Against Extremism, a bloc of “like-minded democratic states” convened by the progressive leaders of Spain, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Uruguay to “advance an active democratic diplomacy” in the face of institutional erosion.

In Defense of Democracy has met three times since Brazilian President Lula da Silva and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez launched the initiative at the 2024 UN General Assembly, citing the 2021 U.S. Capitol attack and the 2023 Brasília attacks as their catalyst. That inaugural summit featured an array of democratic leaders—including progressives from Norway, Timor-Leste, and Senegal, as well as centrist and center-left figures such as Emmanuel Macron and Justin Trudeau—and touched on themes familiar to democracy watchers everywhere: ideological extremism, institutional distrust, and affective polarization, among others. Mostly, participants seemed preoccupied with making sense of the crisis at hand. “Where,” Lula asked in his final remarks, “did democracy go so wrong?”

The subsequent In Defense of Democracy meetings have answered this question with growing clarity—or at least more ideological certainty. In their joint statement at the follow-up summit in Santiago in July, Lula, Sánchez, Chilean President Gabriel Boric, Colombian President Gustavo Petro, and Uruguayan President Yamandú Orsi repeatedly invoked “big capital” and “austerity policies” as the principal causes behind the demise of the democratic consensus. Although their course of action appeared vague, they showed little doubt that future democratic consolidation would be led by “progressive leaders.” The September gathering at the UN General Assembly opening reflected as much: Gone were the moderate figures of the original quorum, replaced by a uniform front of left-wing leaders, including representatives from Albania, Bolivia, and Honduras.

Their initiative—like any effort in pro-democratic multilateralism—is welcome in this moment of democratic collapse. Now more than ever, leaders committed to the democratic path need to step up and set an ambitious new agenda. But if a group of Ibero-American governments and their progressive allies are to help fill the emptying ranks of international democratic leadership, In Defense of Democracy must learn the right lessons from previous intergovernmental democracy initiatives. That means building an inclusive coalition without sacrificing normative coherence—and putting real resources behind abstract commitments.

In the optimistic atmosphere of the 1990s, “democracy clubs” emerged as venues for the world’s growing ranks of democratic governments to come together, share best practices, and advance global democratic diplomacy. The most notable of these venues was the Community of Democracies (CoD), which U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Polish Foreign Minister Bronisław Geremek founded in 2000 to “support adherence to common democratic values and standards” as outlined in the Warsaw Declaration. For a brief moment, that initiative appeared to give structure to the post–Cold War democratic order. But within a decade, CoD had faded into bureaucratic irrelevance—its Warsaw-based secretariat lacking resources and authority, its meetings attended by sparse numbers of midlevel envoys, and its founding democratic commitments routinely ignored by member states. Hungary’s democratic retrenchment under Prime Minister Viktor Orbán—as well as the continued participation of authoritarian governments from Thailand and Venezuela—underscored the organization’s inability to discipline even its most conspicuous violators. What had begun as an ambitious alliance of free nations devolved into a cautionary tale about the difficulties of policing democracy from within.

More recent initiatives like the Summit for Democracy have faced similar tensions between inclusivity and normative coherence—tensions that leaders have negotiated selectively and inconsistently. When planning the 2021 Summit for Democracy, for instance, President Joe Biden excluded backsliders such as Orbán and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, but still opted to include certain anti-democratic actors such as Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte and Angolan President João Lourenço. There is a case to be made against indiscriminate expansion—democracy clubs need to uphold their own values—just as one can argue against excessive pickiness—democracy clubs need to engage the nondemocratic world if they wish to spread norms. But taking the middle path has often meant that democracy clubs neither fully embody democratic principles nor effectively proselytize them.

In Defense of Democracy’s progressive leaders have so far avoided such a dilemma through their strident partisanship. Yet, by pushing total normative conformity—by excluding not only traditional authoritarians, but also conservatives and moderate democrats deemed liable “to accept totalitarian positions”—Lula, Sánchez, and company have built a weak foundation for intergovernmental action.

When participants use the coalition’s forums to be overtly ideological—as outgoing Bolivian President Luis Arce did at UNGA 2025 while describing how “hegemonic actors … in bourgeois sectors… wage war against democracy… in order to serve the interests of concentrated capital”—they hamper both serious empirical analysis of democratic decline and the coalition-building necessary to change course. Partisanship may resonate with In Defense of Democracy leaders’ domestic bases and signal purity of cause, but it will ultimately alienate potential democratic allies and limit strategic relevance in the long term.

This spectrum of partisanship is critical not only for outreach to fragile democracies operating under disparate economic and historical conditions—say, former Eastern Bloc nations where far-left signaling can be unpalatable—but also to sustain the initiative’s core leadership. In democratic regimes, governments inevitably change hands, and multilateral coalitions must be flexible enough to withstand national shifts in power. Chile may have its own right-wing democratic government by 2026, and Brazil and Spain could very well follow. If the current presidents of these countries wish to build a transnational movement that outlasts their own political careers, purity politics of this kind are a nonstarter.

Before In Defense of Democracy leaders meet again in Madrid next year, they should court a more diverse set of democratic partners, including moderate figures such Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and center-right leaders such as Portuguese Prime Minister Luis Montenegro and Bolivia’s new president, Rodrigo Paz. While Lula, Sánchez, and their allies must avoid conferring legitimacy on authoritarian regimes—as CoD and Summit for Democracy have done—they should also broaden their conception of the democratic tradition they are ostensibly defending.

https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/09/nepal-gen-z-topple-government?lang=en,Iran’s Water Crisis Is a Warning to Other Countries,"Earlier this month, Iranian officials warned that Tehran could run out of drinking water within two weeks due to a historic drought. In the past year, the country’s average annual rainfall has dropped to 45 percent below normal, and nineteen of its thirty-one provinces are in a severe drought. The dams and reservoirs that supply the capital have dried up and are operating at minimal capacity, with some at only 5 percent of reserve capacity. Fears of an emergency evacuation of the capital are mounting, and taps are running dry.

Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and President Masoud Pezeshkian have both publicly acknowledged the severity and seriousness of a crisis that has been years in the making. But without addressing the root causes, any mitigation efforts will likely fall short—setting Iran up as an example for its neighbors and others facing water crises of their own.

A Long-Building Crisis

For Iran, the water scarcity crisis is a cruel irony, given the country had pioneered water management systems—known as the qanat or karez—millennia ago. During the past several decades, it abandoned and replaced the qanat with wells, aquifers, and other modern systems that were less efficient or environmentally friendly. Since the early 2000s (if not before), and despite constructing hundreds of dams and reservoirs to create a more consistent water supply, the state faced a worsening crisis, with the annual groundwater availability, storage, and recharge steadily declining.

The crisis is also the byproduct of factors such as population growth, rising demand, resource exploitation, and uneven distribution—many of which are aggravated by climate change and prolonged drought. Government mismanagement and corruption also contributed: The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp’s dam-building firm, Sepasad, was one of several companies that prioritized political power and predatory profit-seeking over water preservation, ecological protection, and public prosperity. Some in Iran refer to Sepasad and its collaborators as the “water mafia.”

Starting in the 2010s, Iranian and UN officials openly declared the situation a crisis. In July 2013, the former Minister of Agriculture Isa Kalantari famously stated that the shrinking water supply constituted a bigger threat to Iran than its external enemies or elite infighting and could cause the country to become uninhabitable in the future. An ongoing symptom and symbol of the crisis was Lake Urmia in northwest Iran: Once among the world’s largest saltwater lakes, Urmia was steadily shrinking, in spite of a decade of restoration efforts.

In Tehran, the crisis is particularly acute: Last year, rainfall totals dropped 42 percent below the long-term average, at the same time as the capital set records for water consumption. The city and province are in the midst of a five-year drought, when in the past, two dry years had been followed by a wet one.

The Impacts

In July, Pezeshkian cautioned that the crisis could compel Tehran’s 15 million residents to flee. But in the northern and wealthier part of the city, adequate infrastructure, advanced distribution, and augmented storage made the crisis less pressing—while also demonstrating the socioeconomic disparities at play. Many of these residents aggravated the crisis by consuming up to ten times more water than the average household, primarily for private uses such as bathing, washing cars, and watering gardens.

During the past two decades, if not earlier, the crisis adversely affected agricultural production and accelerated migration from rural areas to cities. In Tehran and other urban centers, these trends strained infrastructure and services, expanded slums, and exacerbated environmental problems and health risks such as traffic congestion and air pollution—all of which increased socioeconomic instability.

The crisis also contributed to several large protests, including some in Isfahan and Khuzestan in 2018, 2021, and 2025 that were specifically triggered by water scarcity. Domestic discontent was particularly prevalent in the marginalized and underdeveloped provinces such as Khuzestan that are located along the ethnic-minority periphery along Iran’s borders. They were disproportionately impacted due in part to the state diverting the area’s water supply to more privileged and prosperous provinces in Iran’s Persian-majority center to compensate for their water deficits.

In July, when an Iranian academic announced the apocalyptic scenario that a national drinking water shortage was weeks away, she identified the lack of institutional coordination at the state level as impeding a solution. A survey conducted in September found that 75 percent of Iranians blamed the crisis on mismanagement and inefficiency instead of natural factors and economic sanctions.

Temporary Solutions for a Long-Term Problem

To date, the state mainly has attempted to manage the crisis by implementing short-term stopgap measures. These include rationing and importing water, shuttering government offices, declaring more public holidays, suspending social services, and penalizing households and businesses for overconsumption. Meanwhile, residential and commercial property owners, managers, and tenants with low-to-no water pressure have been forced to purchase or lease tanks to temporarily increase storage. For its part, the state continues to contemplate evacuating the capital and has proceeded with periodic supply cuts in certain neighborhoods of cities and provinces. It has also issued more warnings to citizens about the severity of the situation and urged them to conserve water or confront penalties.

To stabilize the supply and maintain the quality of water in Tehran, officials expedited projects, such as a new pipe system that encircled the city and was expected to be completed by the end of 2024. For decades, they tried to expand the sewage systems and wastewater networks of Tehran and other cities to collect, treat, and recycle water. However, these projects were delayed due to issues that included inadequate funding, rapid urbanization, and manhole theft. To reduce consumption, authorities announced in April of this year that users who ignored warnings in anticipation of summer-related outages would face supply cuts for twelve hours. However, they have been unable to stem the tide of the crisis, whether managing it from the demand or supply side.

Until officials devise sensible and sustainable solutions and reforms that adequately address the root causes of the crisis, any actions will continue to be Band-Aids. These solutions and reforms should involve improving interagency and cross-sectoral coordination and developing a national strategy for environmental governance and water management. To mitigate scarcity and optimize usage, the state could establish inspection teams that prevent excessive extraction at legal wells and shut down illegal ones. In certain areas, it could also create water trading and so-called sponge cities, with features such as permeable pavement to absorb rainwater and reduce runoff.

Furthermore, the state could incentivize homes, factories, and farms to install high-efficiency appliances, fixtures, and other equipment—from dishwashers, showerheads, and toilets to systems that monitor, filter, and recycle water. It could also encourage them to adopt prudent processes and practices, such as rapid leak repair, smart meter use, and landscaping that utilizes rain barrels and drought-tolerant plants.

From a bottom-up standpoint or at the societal level, the state should be more inclusive by incorporating the community stakeholders most severely impacted by the crisis into planning and implementation. For example, user associations could be drafted to help manage resources locally.

For Iran, the stakes of formulating and instituting sound policy could not be higher, as the crisis consumes nearly every aspect of national life and contains catastrophic consequences for the foreseeable future. In an age of accelerated climate change and global warming, Iran’s crisis should serve as a warning to other countries inside and outside the region confronting similar issues that short-term measures are not a substitute for state policy and planning.",https://carnegieendowment.org/emissary/2025/11/iran-water-crisis-warning-climate?lang=en,,"Earlier this month, Iranian officials warned that Tehran could run out of drinking water within two weeks due to a historic drought. In the past year, the country’s average annual rainfall has dropped to 45 percent below normal, and nineteen of its thirty-one provinces are in a severe drought. The dams and reservoirs that supply the capital have dried up and are operating at minimal capacity, with some at only 5 percent of reserve capacity. Fears of an emergency evacuation of the capital are mounting, and taps are running dry. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and President Masoud Pezeshkian have both publicly acknowledged the severity and seriousness of a crisis that has been years in the making. But without addressing the root causes, any mitigation efforts will likely fall short—setting Iran up as an example for its neighbors and others facing water crises of their own. A Long-Building Crisis For Iran, the water scarcity crisis is a cruel irony, given the country had pioneered water management systems—known as the qanat or karez—millennia ago. During the past several decades, it abandoned and replaced the qanat with wells, aquifers, and other modern systems that were less efficient or environmentally friendly. Since the early 2000s (if not before), and despite constructing hundreds of dams and reservoirs to create a more consistent water supply, the state faced a worsening crisis, with the annual groundwater availability, storage, and recharge steadily declining. The crisis is also the byproduct of factors such as population growth, rising demand, resource exploitation, and uneven distribution—many of which are aggravated by climate change and prolonged drought. Government mismanagement and corruption also contributed: The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp’s dam-building firm, Sepasad, was one of several companies that prioritized political power and predatory profit-seeking over water preservation, ecological protection, and public prosperity. Some in Iran refer to Sepasad and its collaborators as the “water mafia.” Starting in the 2010s, Iranian and UN officials openly declared the situation a crisis. In July 2013, the former Minister of Agriculture Isa Kalantari famously stated that the shrinking water supply constituted a bigger threat to Iran than its external enemies or elite infighting and could cause the country to become uninhabitable in the future. An ongoing symptom and symbol of the crisis was Lake Urmia in northwest Iran: Once among the world’s largest saltwater lakes, Urmia was steadily shrinking, in spite of a decade of restoration efforts. In Tehran, the crisis is particularly acute: Last year, rainfall totals dropped 42 percent below the long-term average, at the same time as the capital set records for water consumption. The city and province are in the midst of a five-year drought, when in the past, two dry years had been followed by a wet one. The Impacts In July, Pezeshkian cautioned that the crisis could compel Tehran’s 15 million residents to flee. But in the northern and wealthier part of the city, adequate infrastructure, advanced distribution, and augmented storage made the crisis less pressing—while also demonstrating the socioeconomic disparities at play. Many of these residents aggravated the crisis by consuming up to ten times more water than the average household, primarily for private uses such as bathing, washing cars, and watering gardens. During the past two decades, if not earlier, the crisis adversely affected agricultural production and accelerated migration from rural areas to cities. In Tehran and other urban centers, these trends strained infrastructure and services, expanded slums, and exacerbated environmental problems and health risks such as traffic congestion and air pollution—all of which increased socioeconomic instability.

https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/09/nepal-gen-z-topple-government?lang=en,The United States and the Emerging Security Order in Eastern Syria,"Summary

The Assad regime’s downfall in December 2024 marked the emergence of a new security order in Syria. The United States reduced its presence in the country, adopting an approach of flexible oversight in the east, organized around detaining Islamic State prisoners, keeping supply routes open, and securing sensitive sites. The success of a U.S. withdrawal depends on pursuing these priorities while balancing Turkish and Israeli red lines. Failure on either front risks reopening spaces for conflict, including a potential Islamic State revival.

Key Themes

There are three poles of power in northern and eastern Syria, where the U.S. presence is concentrated: the government (now part of the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State), Türkiye-backed structures, and the Kurd-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces.

These parties benefit from, and seek to reduce friction through, agreements on three issues: maintenance of detention facilities for captured Islamic State members, ensuring free movement on main roads, and protecting sensitive sites.

The United States’ role in the east has shifted since the Assad regime’s downfall to becoming a mediator among the parties and maintaining a status quo.

Local dynamics in Syria will play out between two security zones: a Turkish-managed north and an Israeli-monitored south. Between the two, Washington is maintaining a balance of power, a key locus of which is its base at Tanf.

Absent an understanding between Türkiye and Israel, their rivalry will prevent the emergence of a Syrian national framework, allowing conflict in the east that could enable an Islamic State resurgence.

Findings and Recommendations

The viability of the emerging security model in eastern Syria hinges on the harmonization of Turkish and Israeli interests, while Washington maintains a regional control node at Tanf that can neutralize regional threats.

Identity-based mobilization by Damascus must be curbed, otherwise it will generate conflict in the east and throughout Syria. The test for the government is preserving neutrality in enforcing security and avoiding the ad hoc mobilization of supporters through tribal call-ups and mosque networks. These create parallel lines of command, erode social cohesion, and undermine Syria’s transition.

For the United States to withdraw successfully from Syria, it must recognize that only a stable Syrian transition can prevent an Islamic State revival. In the east, any disruption in the continued detention or repatriation of Islamic State prisoners, keeping main roads open, and protecting sensitive sites threatens stability, which could create space for an Islamic State resurgence.

Washington must leverage its channels with Türkiye and Saudi Arabia to help Syria’s leadership craft an inclusive national framework, while constraining sectarian extremism among actors inside the new authority.

On the ground in eastern Syria, conflict avoidance requires a unified hierarchy of command for the Syrian Democratic Forces and those of the Syrian government, professionally managed checkpoints, speedy accountability, and contacts between local police and coordination centers to provide early warning of problems.

Introduction

The fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime on December 8, 2024, led to a new phase in Syria’s security order. The Iranian presence, which had greatly shaped the Syrian conflict after 2011, receded and a new central authority, albeit one limited in reach, emerged in Damascus under Ahmad al-Sharaa, the leader of Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham and now Syria’s president after his appointment by the Military Operations Administration that ousted Assad. This coincided with the United States’ intent to reduce its military presence in eastern Syria. The nature of the security arrangements previously overseen by the Americans changed, as what had been a static form of deterrence gave way to an ad hoc approach focused on day-to-day risk management of developments on the ground.

There are three major poles of power in northern and eastern Syria today. There is the new central authority in Damascus, Türkiye-backed structures in the north, and the Kurd-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in the east. Not all the parties are seeking to unify institutions under the authority of Damascus, though that is the intention of the Syrian government and Türkiye, but they do want to reduce friction through working arrangements that keep passages open so that all sides can benefit. In this environment, the United States has been focused on managing their interaction by using the limited tools at its disposal—calibrated deterrence, discrete mediation, and monitoring—to initiate a gradual drawdown of its forces without creating a security vacuum.

Regional dynamics have played a major role in shaping this situation. For instance, Israeli freedom of military action has raised the cost of entrenchment by Israel’s rivals, above all Türkiye, affecting the military situation nationwide, including in the east. Türkiye previously targeted the SDF’s military structure, forcing constant adjustments in how vital communication channels, such as roads, are managed and important sites protected. In this context, the success of a U.S. drawdown will have less to do with troop numbers and more with enforceable daily guidelines or procedures carried out by local actors in facilities for detaining members of the Islamic State group, at checkpoints, and along communication lines in the region. These rules will determine whether the current arrangements hold or whether they create new openings for an Islamic State revival.

The Emergence of the U.S. Role in Syria

In the past decade, the United States’ role in Syria has been shaped by three overlapping developments. The first was the campaign against the Islamic State, which dismantled the group’s territorial caliphate by 2019, but did not end the possibility that it might revitalize itself. The second was the growing bipartisan sentiment in Washington, amplified by President Donald Trump, that the United States needed to avoid open-ended foreign conflicts. The third was the establishment of a small but strategic U.S. base at Tanf, near the Syrian-Jordanian-Iraqi border, which gave the United States geopolitical leverage beyond the campaign against the Islamic State. These dynamics together defined the limited and security-driven U.S. mission in Syria prior to the Assad regime’s collapse.

The U.S. role in Syria emerged as a functional response to the Islamic State’s expansion in 2014. Washington separated the Iraq and Syria theaters operationally and built on local partnerships under an advise-assist-enable model backed by airpower. The near-term aim was narrow—reversing the Islamic State’s territorial control and disrupting its command-and-control structures—even as the Americans recognized that the group’s brand and pathways toward regeneration would outlast its physical caliphate. Once the Islamic State lost all its territory, the U.S. mission shifted to managing risk. This involved containing still-active Islamic State cells, professionalizing partner forces that had helped fight the group, and institutionalizing deconfliction among the parties active in the east so that local antagonism would not lead to escalation that might undermine the new reality.

The U.S.-led Campaign Against the Islamic State

The U.S.-led coalition to defeat the Islamic State, which was formed in 2014, became the centerpiece of Western involvement in Syria. At its height, it coordinated the actions of over eighty states and institutions, relying on airstrikes, intelligence, and a partnership with the SDF. By 2019, when the Islamic State lost its territorial holdings, the coalition’s mission narrowed to preventing the group’s resurgence by detaining thousands of captured fighters and maintaining a residual U.S. presence in northeastern Syria and Tanf.

Today, the Islamic State no longer poses the threat it once did, but it remains active. Sleeper cells continue to engage in ambushes, assassinations, and bombings, mainly in the northeast. These operations, though limited, demonstrate the dangers of a broader security breakdown if left unchecked. The incarceration of Islamic State fighters in SDF-run facilities adds another layer of instability, with its unresolved legal and humanitarian consequences. Preventing the group’s resurgence remains one of Washington’s justifications for its deployment, but the urgency of the mission has clearly diminished. As the U.S. footprint narrows, the coalition’s value is increasingly being measured by how the complex ties between the actors involved in northern and eastern Syria are managed.

As of early 2025, the imprisonment of Islamic State prisoners remained one of the most sensitive questions for the coalition formed to fight the group. According to a March 2025 study by the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism, roughly 8,500 male Islamic State affiliates are being held across more than two-dozen SDF-run detention centers. Among them are 5,400 Syrians and 3,100 foreign nationals, including about 1,600 Iraqis.

In parallel to the detention system are the massive camps that house the families of suspected Islamic State members. The two largest, Al-Hol and Roj, together hold an estimated 38,000 people, including some 23,000 foreign nationals, more than 60 percent of whom are children, most under the age of twelve. Their conditions remain dire: humanitarian access is limited, governance is precarious, and the camps have at times served as spaces of radicalization and informal justice. Amnesty International estimates that up to 46,500 people, the majority of whom are women and children, are being held across this network of camps and prisons, most without formal charges being leveled against them.

The U.S. military presence that underwrites this fragile order has steadily contracted. As of late 2024, the Pentagon reported roughly 2,000 U.S. troops deployed in Syria under the Combined Joint Task Force–Operation Inherent Resolve mandate. While exact figures fluctuate, Washington has signaled its intention to reduce its forces, and did so in 2025, concentrating them in a handful of strategic sites around Hasakeh and Deir Ezzor Governorates. Thus far, the presence of these troops, though limited in number, remains critical for the maintenance of secure detention conditions, aerial surveillance, and the deterrence of a renewed Islamic State insurgency in Syria’s northeast.

U.S. Domestic Attitudes Toward Intervention Overseas

A second factor shaping Syria policy is the deepening skepticism in the United States toward foreign military interventions abroad. Trump’s return to office in 2025 only reinforced this trend. Within his administration, two broad camps are competing for influence. On the one side are advocates of restraint, who argue that Syria exemplifies one of the “forever wars” in regions that are peripheral to vital U.S. interests. Many of Trump’s close allies, including Vice President J. D. Vance and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, lean toward this view. Their arguments emphasize the drain on resources of such interventions, as well as the endless nature of entanglements in local rivalries, which leads to limited strategic payoffs.

On the other side are national security hawks, such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Senator Lindsey Graham, who though not a member of the administration has the presidents’ ear and is a member of influential congressional committees, including the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. They warn that a U.S. withdrawal from Syria risks allowing a jihadi resurgence as well as renewed Iranian influence and Russian meddling. Their argument is that even a small U.S. footprint offers outsized benefits in terms of deterrence, intelligence gathering, and regional leverage.

Trump treats these divisions less as a doctrinal matter than as bargaining leverage. His approach to Syria is transactional and shaped by regional alignments. The U.S. decision in May 2025 to lift some sanctions on the Sharaa government, taken partly at Saudi Arabia’s behest, illustrates this flexibility. Disengagement from Syria is not straightforward, but is folded into calculations over the possibility of normalization between Syria and Israel, an understanding between Türkiye and Iran in Syria, as well as Iran’s containment. In this light, the ongoing U.S. withdrawal from Syria is not a strategic pivot so much as the culmination of shifting priorities and domestic pressures. It reflects the exhaustion of the Islamic State mission, the transformation of Syria’s political landscape, and the influence of restraint-oriented voices in Washington.

In November 2025, the United States took several steps toward engaging with the Damascus leadership under Sharaa. During the Syrian president’s visit to the White House (the first by a Syrian head of state), Washington announced that Syria would join the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State and that the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2019—U.S. legislation sanctioning the former Assad regime, but still in place—would be suspended for 180 days. The administration also confirmed that Syria would be allowed to reopen its embassy in Washington, restoring diplomatic relations for the first time since 2012. Sharaa, who until recently had been designated a global terrorist, was formally removed from U.S. sanctions list. Trump publicly endorsed the new Syrian leader, framing the relationship as the beginning of a “new era” of cooperation.

Such cooperation notwithstanding, public opinion polls both reflect and help drive the Trump administration’s efforts to identify an appropriate framework for disengagement from Syria and the broader Middle East. A Pew Research Center survey conducted in March 2025 found that 52 percent of Americans believed it was better if the United States paid less attention to the affairs of other nations. This reflected broader doubts about military engagements, specifically in the Middle East. For instance, a Quinnipiac University poll conducted in June 2025 revealed that 51 percent of voters opposed the United States joining Israel in conducting military strikes against Iran’s nuclear sites, with 42 percent in favor.

This reluctance is not necessarily rooted in isolationism but is often coupled with a heightened focus on countering China’s growing international influence. A July 2025 Chicago Council on Global Affairs survey indicated that, since 1998, when the council began polling attitudes toward critical threats to the United States and its interests, there has been a decline in the percentage of respondents who consider international terrorism a critical threat, even if 55 percent still regard it as such. Meanwhile, other issues have become more salient, including the emergence of China as a world power (50 percent) and the global economic downturn (49 percent). The historical context illuminates this shift. The conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, which together resulted in over 7,000 U.S. military deaths and cost trillions of dollars, left lasting impacts on public sentiment. They led to a reevaluation of U.S. military commitments, particularly in regions where critical U.S. national interests were not seen to be at stake. This is having a major effect on the Trump administration’s desire to ensure that its footprint in Syria remains very limited.

The Tanf Garrison and U.S. Possibilities in Syria

A third factor defining U.S. behavior in Syria is the establishment of the Tanf base in the country’s southeast, which the United States has transformed into a strategic asset. Established in 2016, the base sits astride the Baghdad-Damascus highway, once a vital Iranian supply route to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Tanf potentially allows the U.S. to monitor and disrupt Iranian logistics, protect Jordan from instability in Syria, and project surveillance and rapid-reaction capabilities across the volatile Syria-Iraq-Jordan triborder area. Though the Tanf garrison hosted fewer than 500 troops as of December 2024, its value far outweighs its size. As late as April 2025, the Americans were still training a small Syrian force there, now called Division 70 of the Syrian army.

Together, the anti-Islamic State mission and presence in Tanf reflect Washington’s preference for a calibrated engagement in Syria, one that is security-focused and deliberately limited. This has allowed the United States to retain leverage in the country without becoming entangled in the details of political life or large-scale reconstruction. Such an attitude, in turn, has aligned with domestic pressures to minimize overseas commitments. These priorities continue to shape Washington’s attitudes toward Syria. However, the emergence of a new political order in Damascus, backed by Türkiye but opposed by the SDF and certain minority communities that feel threatened, has introduced a new triangular relationship overshadowing older concerns. The future of U.S. strategy in Syria, in particular the feasibility of a withdrawal from the country, will hinge on how successfully Washington manages this multifaceted arrangement.

Reshaping the U.S. Security Model After the Assad Regime’s Collapse

After 2014, the U.S. security model in eastern Syria relied on limited local partnerships, a network of small military outposts, and the presence of the Tanf base. This model served a dual purpose: containing the Islamic State and interdicting Iran’s land routes to Hezbollah across the Syrian desert. But with the collapse of the Assad regime, Iran’s exit from Syria, and the rollback of Russian involvement in the country, the continued pursuit of such an approach was both logistically and politically untenable. Washington now faces an entirely new geopolitical landscape, one defined by wide open spaces, not internal boundaries as during the Syrian conflict. What is in place is a fragmented security environment attractive to jihadi actors and characterized by fluid local alliances, all this overseen by a relatively new, institutionally weak, Syrian central authority.

The Move Toward a New U.S. Security Order in Syria

The U.S. security architecture in Syria after 2014 was, paradoxically, predicated on the continued existence of the Assad regime and the limited stabilizing, albeit also brutal, roles played by Russia and Iran. The United States, for its part, opted to operate from relatively secure zones on Syria’s geographical periphery, such as areas east of the Euphrates and at the Tanf base, while maintaining a military partnership with the SDF. Even as Washington supported local stabilization programs in select opposition-held areas, it did not commit to permanent governance or state-building efforts nationally.

However, this model was never designed to withstand the changes that followed the regime’s collapse. After the partial U.S. withdrawal in 2018, triggered by Türkiye’s Operation Peace Spring, Washington’s room for maneuver has shrunk significantly. The political and strategic factors that had given the U.S. model its semblance of legitimacy, namely the Russian and Iranian presence in Syria, began to erode and the situation in the country has now radically shifted. Consequently, since Trump took office in January 2025, U.S. operations have been suspended at four bases, with overall troop levels falling to below 1,000 soldiers. The American military saw a transformation in its role from direct actor to mediator and observer.

In this context, for the United States stability in eastern Syria depends on keeping three functions in balance: managing the detention, transfer, and repatriation of combatants mainly of the Islamic State group; ensuring the safe movement of people, goods, and services on key roads; and protecting sensitive sites, such as military and intelligence centers as well as detention sites for Islamic State militants, and energy facilities. If any one of these priorities breaks down, it may create spaces for a revival of the Islamic State, while also exacerbating regional tensions and local sensitivities. Indeed, Washington’s main goals are to ensure that nothing undermines the status quo in eastern Syria in a way that threatens U.S. interests, while it also seeks to prevent an Islamic State resurgence and ensure that local incidents do not escalate into broader conflagrations.

This repositioning reflects a conscious shift from the previous static form of deterrence, meaning operations launched from permanent sites using fixed military capabilities, toward more flexible oversight, denoting a more dynamic U.S. posture emphasizing monitoring, deconfliction, and mediation among parties on the ground. The Americans in eastern Syria are redefining their role from that of a military guarantor to being a political broker, where they are now facilitating dialogue between the SDF and the new authorities in Damascus, as well as between Türkiye and the SDF. But what is needed is the careful construction of a more durable security model. It remains to be seen what this might look like, however, as the unraveling of the previous security order has opened the door to a volatile security environment in which actors old and new are now vying for influence.

Since December, Syria has faced a new form of security fragmentation. Across the country’s now open geography, from the eastern desert to Raqqa to the southern border regions around Daraa and Suwayda, there are no longer lines of control. Absent a single actor able to manage competing factions or enforce coherent territorial boundaries, the political landscape has created potential spaces for jihadi mobilization, particularly among Islamic State remnants and unaffiliated militants seeking an opportunity to reemerge.

The Islamic State has seized on this transformation, recalibrating its rhetoric and messaging. By mid-2025, Al-Naba’, one of the group’s official media outlets, was publishing weekly editorials targeting Sharaa, branding him a traitor and an apostate. Once a member of the Islamic State, Sharaa later led Jabhat al-Nusra, an earlier rendition of Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, a battlefield rival of the Islamic State in Deir Ezzor. He is now seen as the face of a new political order in Damascus, an outcome viewed by many jihadis as an ideological betrayal. The reason is that Sharaa has shifted from jihadi militancy to political leadership, which requires compromise and engagement with countries in the region—such as Türkiye and Saudi Arabia—and internationally.

In response to Sharaa’s November visit to Washington and Syria’s formal declaration of joining the international coalition to fight the Islamic State, Islamic State media outlets framed the development as a betrayal of Sunni interests, arguing that Sharaa, like Türkiye under Mustapha Kemal Atatürk, had abandoned Islam and joined with the West, effectively becoming an instrument of an international order hostile to Islam. The group sought to delegitimize any Western-friendly Sunni political project in Syria, reserving all religious and ideological authority for itself. In contrast, Syrian Justice Minister Mazhar al-Wais, himself a former Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham member, defended Syria’s alignment with the coalition. He framed the agreement as a form of cooperation that strengthened Syrian state sovereignty and oversight while targeting the residual threat posed by the Islamic State, asserting that such coordination did not constitute military subordination to outside powers or a breach of religious law.

For Türkiye, the primary objective in the northeast is to dismantle the military architecture of the SDF and ensure it is not normalized. A major component of the SDF is the Kurdish People’s Protection Units, or YPG, which Ankara regards as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which it considers a terrorist organization. The Turkish aim is to eliminate the PKK’s cross-border influence, integrate any residual SDF structures into Syria’s state security hierarchy, and preclude the emergence of a semi-autonomous security order. Turkish officials have signaled that the YPG’s eradication is their aim, and that Ankara will intervene to prevent any arrangement that preserves the group’s de facto autonomy, especially if diplomatic tracks stall. In practice, its calibrated strikes, pressure through Turkish-backed factions, and political efforts to influence the decisions of the Syrian government with regard to the SDF are all aimed at keeping the SDF’s leadership off balance, until a post-SDF security configuration can be put in place.

The United States, in turn, treats Syria first and foremost as a counterterrorism sphere. Its immediate objective is to employ small but mobile U.S. forces to prevent the Islamic State from reviving, while at the same time keeping an eye on other jihadi groups, for example the Turkestan Islamic Party, made up of Uyghurs, which has ties to the current Syrian regime. This means participating in targeted raids against jihadis, dismantling active cells, in addition to other undertakings, such as engaging in routine deconfliction to prevent local incidents from escalating and creating an environment that allows the Islamic State in particular to reinforce itself. While the United States supports the idea of one Syrian nation, one army, and one government, it has been mainly focused on managing the situation on the ground and neutralizing threats, not in engaging in nation building or holding territory. This is a position that can be sustained even as the numbers of U.S. ground forces in Syria and Iraq continue to decline.

One dimension of this counterterrorism concern is the detention and repatriation of Islamic State prisoners. U.S. Central Command, or CENTCOM, has announced a Joint Repatriation Cell in northeast Syria to speed lawful returns to home countries from Al-Hol and Roj and reduce the pool of prisoners who might pose a risk though their continued imprisonment. In parallel, the meeting between Sharaa and CENTCOM Commander Brad Cooper in September 2025 highlighted the existence of a practical channel for coordinating on the repatriation of displaced persons and detainees from Islamic State-controlled camps, as well as maintaining oversight of remaining threats from the group. This mechanism helps prevent security vacuums as the U.S. footprint in Syria decreases.

U.S. actions are taking place in an atmosphere of instability across post-Assad Syria, driven primarily by sectarian violence. Pro-government armed factions and local coalitions have established de facto control in sections of the country’s coastal areas and in Suwayda, amid state weakness. These developments have reignited longstanding tensions and grievances, particularly among rural Sunnis who once formed the backbone of the Islamic State’s support base. The June 2025 suicide bombing at St. Elias Church in Damascus, carried out during mass, was emblematic of this escalation. It followed weeks of incitement on jihadi Telegram channels, which are increasingly stigmatizing Syria’s minority communities and accusing the Sharaa regime of protecting them in order to pander to Western countries. Similarly, in April–May 2025, fighting broke out between government-affiliated forces and Druze gunmen in the suburbs of Damascus before spreading to Suwayda, which led to Israeli intervention in defense of the Druze, an influential community inside Israel. Since then, there has been widespread mistrust of the government among the Druze, undermining short-term prospects for reconciliation.



Meanwhile, the Arab-Kurdish relationship in eastern Syria has sparked renewed tensions. In October, clashes in the Kurdish-majority neighborhoods of Sheikh Maqsoud and Ashrafieh in Aleppo led to fighting between SDF-aligned security units and government forces, before Sharaa and the SDF commander Mazloum Abdi concluded a new truce, in the presence of the U.S. envoy to Syria and the commander of U.S. forces. Despite years of coordination between the SDF and the Americans, the gradual U.S. withdrawal and Washington’s attempts to facilitate the political incorporation of the SDF into the Syrian state within a formal reconciliation framework have revived old sensitivities. The August 8, 2025, Hasakeh Conference, organized by the SDF with the participation of minority communal representatives, presented a vision for a decentralized, democratic Syria, but was not welcomed by the authorities in Damascus. Kurdish leaders, in turn, fear that a reduction in U.S. backing will strip them of the gains they made after 2015 and leave them isolated in a political transition that they too profoundly distrust.

Among the Arab tribes of Deir Ezzor and Raqqa, many feel they were used to support a Kurdish-led project that did not represent them. The rise of a governing structure with an Islamic character in Damascus, supported by Turkish influence in the north, has revived their fear of renewed marginalization under a new Syrian central authority. However, it has also heightened political ambitions among Sunni tribal elites, who see an opportunity to entrench their influence in Syria’s emerging security sector. Dozens of influential security officials hail from Deir Ezzor, and specifically from the Aqidat tribe and the town of Shuhail, a stronghold of Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham’s predecessor Jabhat al-Nusra. For example, Hussein al-Salama from Deir Ezzor, who is director of the General Intelligence Service, and Youssef al-Hijr, from Shuhail, who is the former head of Hay’at Tahir al-Sham’s Politburo and was named director of foreign affairs in the office of the foreign minister in May, hold sway over new security networks and are increasingly viewed as kingmakers. Ahrar al-Sharqiya, a Turkish-backed Syrian National Army faction rooted in Deir Ezzor’s tribal networks, has also become a central pillar in the military structures of the Syrian government. The faction originated as a tribal formation that then merged into a broader Islamist coalition, and it is now part of the Liberation and Construction Movement. Many tribal actors have come to see themselves, rightly or wrongly, as part of a new Syrian “deep state,” and this has increased Arab tribal mobilization against Kurdish political actors, raising the likelihood of open-ended cycles of communal violence.

The fragility of the institutions of the Syrian state has exacerbated existing risks. Although Sharaa has become the state’s public face, the operative structures of governance remain deficient. The absence of vetting and accountability mechanisms has opened gateways for former jihadi elements to penetrate burgeoning security institutions, directly or through tribal intermediaries. This raises the possibility that the present Syrian state, intentionally or unintentionally, could become a channel for the reabsorption of extremist elements under a new political guise, through well-known social and tribal channels. This is similar to what happened during the years of Islamic State control, when local tribal populations were subjected to a centralized Islamic authority through tribal networks.

A Tripartite Security Framework and its Vulnerabilities

As the United States has moved toward a new security framework to replace the one that collapsed with the downfall of the Assad regime, it has dealt with the different actors in the east on the basis of their functions and limitations. The SDF is its operational anchor in containing the Islamic State: it collaborates with the United States in combating the group, detains prisoners, and helps to dismantle Islamic State cells. Türkiye-backed groups, in turn, have prioritized inhibiting the SDF, which has compelled the Americans to intervene and ensure that the ensuing tensions do not detract from containing the Islamic State. As for the Syrian regime, it seeks instruments of control and political recognition, and has allowed limited security coordination when it aligns with preventing an Islamic State resurgence. Washington has maintained an equilibrium within this uneasy triangle.

Nor is this the only role the Americans are playing. In the Syria-Iraq-Jordan triborder area, the Tanf garrison is engaged in surveillance, the disruption of Islamic State cells, and the interdiction of infiltration attempts by these cells and by Iran-backed groups. The local U.S. partner, Maghawir al-Thawra (Commandos of the Revolution), organizes patrols and engages in quick-reaction tasks under tight rules of engagement, coordinating with Jordan and with U.S. deconfliction channels. The red lines imposed by the Americans are explicit, namely to protect personnel and sites of the anti-Islamic State coalition and prevent any cross-border threats into and from the area. In this way, Tanf complements the SDF’s role in the east and preserves the counterterrorism priority.

Tanf also functions as a regional control node in the emerging security framework. The primary aim here is to monitor and prevent Iran-backed militias from using Iraqi territory to establish a logistical corridor across the Syrian desert toward the Jordanian border, the Golan Heights, and Lebanon. Therefore, for the United States and the coalition, Tanf coordinates in real time with Jordanian air defenses and engages in deconfliction with Baghdad. This effectively places the base outside any process of integration into the Syrian government’s command structure, linking it to regional interests. These interests are centered on border-security coordination involving Amman, Baghdad, Ankara, and the regime in Damascus, while Tanf provides the operational capacity to organize patrols, interdict hostile actions, and engage in rapid response actions. As a result, the base remains a vital hinge in the transition toward a new security framework in Syria, with its ability to deter and neutralize threats in the southeast, thereby filling a gap the Syrian government, the SDF, and Türkiye-backed forces cannot fill on their own. Complicating the picture, southern Syria is an arena in which Israel has enforced two conditions: demilitarization and protection of the Druze. This has yielded an environment that has restricted the Syrian government’s force posture and lowered the odds of a spillover of Syrian dynamics into Jordan and the occupied Golan Heights—allowing Washington to maintain its primary focus on the situation in eastern Syria.





This transitional framework in Syria is, therefore, being defined by two broad forms of external constraints: Turkish pressure in the north to curb the SDF’s expansion and an Israeli ceiling in the south that has blocked the area’s remilitarization. Between the two, Washington has managed to accept Israel’s airstrikes in the south as a reality to be dealt with and pursue its balancing act in the east, while imposing enforceable rules of behavior in the latter built around three priorities: maintaining Islamic State detention facilities, keeping major roads open, and securing sensitive infrastructure.

However, the tripartite arrangement in Syria’s east is characterized by structural constraints and intertwined risks. Turkish-Israeli competition has defined the limits of Türkiye’s and Israel’s influence. At the same time, the Syrian regime’s power structure, which is built on a narrow Sunni rural base and an Islamist ideology, might at any moment trigger identity-based mobilization. Over time, and in the absence of understandings between Türkiye and Israel, their rivalry will impede Syria’s transition process in two ways. First, it will perpetuate Turkish and Israeli spheres of influence—a Turkish north where movement and rules of engagement are set by Ankara and its factions; and an Israeli-dominated south structured by Israel’s conditions and its continued freedom to conduct military strikes. This will prevent the emergence of a national Syrian framework, through which the government can reimpose its authority throughout its territory. And it will mean that the situation in the east will continue to be characterized by conflict and division, therefore fragility, where ad hoc understandings rather than national institutions are employed to resolve issues. This will undercut security arrangements there, opening a window for an Islamic State resurgence, but more broadly, making the east a barometer of the fragmentation and rivalries nationally.

That is why the effectiveness of the nascent security model in the east depends on a harmonization of Turkish and Israeli stakes in Syria—on aligning Israel’s declared freedom of action with Ankara’s red lines—as well as on Washington’s operational posture at Tanf. It also depends on the ability of the Syrian government and its local partners to deliver a consensual political transition in the country. However, Syrian state institutions have been depleted and day-to-day security often relies on short-term understandings. Sectarian tensions are rising, therefore the security test for the current government is straightforward. It involves preserving neutrality in enforcing security throughout the country and preventing mobilization of segments of society along identity lines. The reality, however, is that the authorities in Damascus, to fill gaps in professional policing, have relied on mobilizing combatants along ethnosectarian lines, in the guise of local auxiliaries, mostly made up of its Sunni supporters. The result has been to delegate control to these formations without a clear legal mandate, creating parallel lines of command.

In the Suwayda clashes of July 2025, for example, this took the form of tribal call-ups of forces. Earlier, in March, when intense clashes along the Syrian coast escalated into attacks against civilian Alawite communities, the government’s mobilization of forces took place through mosques. The immediate outcome was that the authorities were not seen as being neutral, and there was no consistency in the orders passed down to units on the ground, allowing for violence against segments of the population. This had a very damaging impact on social cohesion. If this pattern is replicated in the east through tribal mobilization against the Kurds, the security triptych there—detention, road protection, and site protection—will be degraded, allowing adversaries of the government to regain the initiative. If security is based on group loyalty rather than laws applicable to all, the outcome invariably will undermine Syria’s transition and reinforce fragmentation.

In such a tenuous environment, eastern Syria remains the principal place where local shocks have the capacity to cause regional spillover. Any failing, such as an uprising inside a detention facility, a confrontation between Kurdish and Arab communities, or a breakdown in guarding critical stretches of roads, raises the likelihood of spreading and even encouraging cross-border intervention. The two most likely parties exploiting such a situation are Türkiye and Iran. On the Turkish side, Ankara’s hostility to the SDF’s expansion could lead to Turkish strikes, the disruption of operating hours at border crossings or of the passage of humanitarian convoys, and looser discipline among local Arab Sunnis along and around the M4 highway stretching from Aleppo to Raqqa and beyond. As for Iran, it could seek to exploit instability by using its Iraqi allies to take advantage of reduced Syrian control over the Qa’im-Bukamal corridor. This, in turn, would create more room to maneuver for Iraqi militias familiar with the geography of the area stretching from Anbar Governorate in Iraq to the eastern desert in Syria, known as the Badia, allowing the Iranians to regain a foothold in the country. And as a result, this could also provoke an Israeli response that leads to regional hostilities.

In practical terms, anything that diverts attention in eastern Syria away from counterterrorism and escalates clashes among communities because of identity questions, sectarian or ethnic, would recreate the conditions in place prior to 2013. At the time, the Badia was easily traversable, the infrastructure for detaining jihadi prisoners was limited and subject to breaches, and groups tended to be activated based on a perception of group threat. Replicating such an environment today would facilitate the revival of jihadi groups in a more decentralized context, only reinforcing the need to guard against any undermining of the three security priorities mentioned earlier.

All parties acknowledge the risks, but U.S. policy in eastern Syria focuses on keeping them in check. Two tracks run in parallel. Track one involves the ties between the SDF and Damascus and includes pilot security understanding to integrate and cooperate on specific matters. Track two is a working template among the Syrian authorities, Türkiye, and the SDF to lock in measurable “small packages.” These include formulating clear detention protocols, protecting specific road segments, and establishing mechanisms for deconfliction of tensions in the area. The United States can mediate between Damascus, the SDF, and Türkiye, but it cannot police daily compliance. The behavior of the parties at checkpoints, the discipline of units on the ground, sensitivities at the village and tribal levels, and the neutrality of government forces in enforcing decisions all play out locally, and local calculations usually prevail over top-down decisions coming from Damascus.

In the end, dynamics at the local level will determine whether the model in place survives and can be consolidated. These local dynamics will unfold between two fixed security zones: a Turkish-managed north, including the M4 corridor, and an Israeli-monitored south where the freedom to attack is maintained. For as long as these two zones of influence are in conflict, the government in Damascus will be unable to unify Syria under its authority, while this situation will only ensure that fragmentation persists in the east, with the likelihood that the region will remain a zone of tension.

That is why four elements are necessary for the parties to maintain a balance in eastern Syria and a measure of stability: a unified hierarchy of command down to the lowest levels; professional, non-selective practices at checkpoints; rapid accountability that imposes visible costs for violations; and early-warning channels linking local police to known coordination hubs. Where these elements do not exist, control will tend to revert to forces mobilized in an ad hoc manner that can morph into identity-based conflicts creating spaces for a variety of actors to threaten Syria’s stability: the Islamic State, Iran and its allies, Türkiye, and Israel, among others.

Conclusion

The collapse of the Assad regime in December 2024 ushered in a period of uncertainty in Syria, where the old U.S. security architecture—built around containing and degrading the Islamic State and maintaining a presence at the Tanf base—was no longer viable. In its place, a pragmatic, tripartite arrangement is emerging, centered on the authorities in Damascus, Turkish-backed structures in the north, and the SDF east of the Euphrates. It remains to be seen whether this arrangement will create a unified security order, but it has managed risk, reduced friction, and maintained essential operating norms in competing zones of control.

Washington’s approach has reflected this reality. The Americans have been involved in low-cost mediation, targeted deterrence, and incremental, measurable interventions, which they have prioritized over institution-building or sponsoring a comprehensive Syrian political settlement. Integrating the Syrian government into the anti-Islamic State coalition also provides an opportunity to assess the government’s capacity to manage security and maintain territorial stability. Success depends less on external power projection and more on local execution, such as neutral enforcement of decisions at checkpoints, adherence to detention protocols, and the continuity of critical services. The most acute risks remain sectarian mobilization, tribal and communal disputes, and gaps in security oversight, particularly in the east, where small lapses could trigger broader instability and facilitate a jihadi resurgence.",https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/12/the-united-states-and-the-emerging-security-order-in-eastern-syria?lang=en&center=middle-east,,"Summary The Assad regime’s downfall in December 2024 marked the emergence of a new security order in Syria. The United States reduced its presence in the country, adopting an approach of flexible oversight in the east, organized around detaining Islamic State prisoners, keeping supply routes open, and securing sensitive sites. The success of a U.S. withdrawal depends on pursuing these priorities while balancing Turkish and Israeli red lines. Failure on either front risks reopening spaces for conflict, including a potential Islamic State revival. Key Themes There are three poles of power in northern and eastern Syria, where the U.S. presence is concentrated: the government (now part of the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State), Türkiye-backed structures, and the Kurd-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces. These parties benefit from, and seek to reduce friction through, agreements on three issues: maintenance of detention facilities for captured Islamic State members, ensuring free movement on main roads, and protecting sensitive sites. The United States’ role in the east has shifted since the Assad regime’s downfall to becoming a mediator among the parties and maintaining a status quo. Local dynamics in Syria will play out between two security zones: a Turkish-managed north and an Israeli-monitored south. Between the two, Washington is maintaining a balance of power, a key locus of which is its base at Tanf. Absent an understanding between Türkiye and Israel, their rivalry will prevent the emergence of a Syrian national framework, allowing conflict in the east that could enable an Islamic State resurgence. Findings and Recommendations The viability of the emerging security model in eastern Syria hinges on the harmonization of Turkish and Israeli interests, while Washington maintains a regional control node at Tanf that can neutralize regional threats. Identity-based mobilization by Damascus must be curbed, otherwise it will generate conflict in the east and throughout Syria. The test for the government is preserving neutrality in enforcing security and avoiding the ad hoc mobilization of supporters through tribal call-ups and mosque networks. These create parallel lines of command, erode social cohesion, and undermine Syria’s transition. For the United States to withdraw successfully from Syria, it must recognize that only a stable Syrian transition can prevent an Islamic State revival. In the east, any disruption in the continued detention or repatriation of Islamic State prisoners, keeping main roads open, and protecting sensitive sites threatens stability, which could create space for an Islamic State resurgence. Washington must leverage its channels with Türkiye and Saudi Arabia to help Syria’s leadership craft an inclusive national framework, while constraining sectarian extremism among actors inside the new authority. On the ground in eastern Syria, conflict avoidance requires a unified hierarchy of command for the Syrian Democratic Forces and those of the Syrian government, professionally managed checkpoints, speedy accountability, and contacts between local police and coordination centers to provide early warning of problems. Introduction The fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime on December 8, 2024, led to a new phase in Syria’s security order. The Iranian presence, which had greatly shaped the Syrian conflict after 2011, receded and a new central authority, albeit one limited in reach, emerged in Damascus under Ahmad al-Sharaa, the leader of Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham and now Syria’s president after his appointment by the Military Operations Administration that ousted Assad. This coincided with the United States’ intent to reduce its military presence in eastern Syria. The nature of the security arrangements previously overseen by the Americans changed, as what had been a static form of deterrence gave way to an ad hoc approach focused on day-to-day risk management of developments on the ground. There are three major poles of power in northern and eastern Syria today. There is the new central authority in Damascus, Türkiye-backed structures in the north, and the Kurd-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in the east. Not all the parties are seeking to unify institutions under the authority of Damascus, though that is the intention of the Syrian government and Türkiye, but they do want to reduce friction through working arrangements that keep passages open so that all sides can benefit. In this environment, the United States has been focused on managing their interaction by using the limited tools at its disposal—calibrated deterrence, discrete mediation, and monitoring—to initiate a gradual drawdown of its forces without creating a security vacuum. Regional dynamics have played a major role in shaping this situation. For instance, Israeli freedom of military action has raised the cost of entrenchment by Israel’s rivals, above all Türkiye, affecting the military situation nationwide, including in the east. Türkiye previously targeted the SDF’s military structure, forcing constant adjustments in how vital communication channels, such as roads, are managed and important sites protected. In this context, the success of a U.S. drawdown will have less to do with troop numbers and more with enforceable daily guidelines or procedures carried out by local actors in facilities for detaining members of the Islamic State group, at checkpoints, and along communication lines in the region. These rules will determine whether the current arrangements hold or whether they create new openings for an Islamic State revival. The Emergence of the U.S. Role in Syria In the past decade, the United States’ role in Syria has been shaped by three overlapping developments. The first was the campaign against the Islamic State, which dismantled the group’s territorial caliphate by 2019, but did not end the possibility that it might revitalize itself. The second was the growing bipartisan sentiment in Washington, amplified by President Donald Trump, that the United States needed to avoid open-ended foreign conflicts. The third was the establishment of a small but strategic U.S. base at Tanf, near the Syrian-Jordanian-Iraqi border, which gave the United States geopolitical leverage beyond the campaign against the Islamic State. These dynamics together defined the limited and security-driven U.S. mission in Syria prior to the Assad regime’s collapse. The U.S. role in Syria emerged as a functional response to the Islamic State’s expansion in 2014. Washington separated the Iraq and Syria theaters operationally and built on local partnerships under an advise-assist-enable model backed by airpower. The near-term aim was narrow—reversing the Islamic State’s territorial control and disrupting its command-and-control structures—even as the Americans recognized that the group’s brand and pathways toward regeneration would outlast its physical caliphate. Once the Islamic State lost all its territory, the U.S. mission shifted to managing risk. This involved containing still-active Islamic State cells, professionalizing partner forces that had helped fight the group, and institutionalizing deconfliction among the parties active in the east so that local antagonism would not lead to escalation that might undermine the new reality. The U.S.-led Campaign Against the Islamic State The U.S.-led coalition to defeat the Islamic State, which was formed in 2014, became the centerpiece of Western involvement in Syria. At its height, it coordinated the actions of over eighty states and institutions, relying on airstrikes, intelligence, and a partnership with the SDF. By 2019, when the Islamic State lost its territorial holdings, the coalition’s mission narrowed to preventing the group’s resurgence by detaining thousands of captured fighters and maintaining a residual U.S. presence in northeastern Syria and Tanf. Today, the Islamic State no longer poses the threat it once did, but it remains active. Sleeper cells continue to engage in ambushes, assassinations, and bombings, mainly in the northeast. These operations, though limited, demonstrate the dangers of a broader security breakdown if left unchecked. The incarceration of Islamic State fighters in SDF-run facilities adds another layer of instability, with its unresolved legal and humanitarian consequences. Preventing the group’s resurgence remains one of Washington’s justifications for its deployment, but the urgency of the mission has clearly diminished. As the U.S. footprint narrows, the coalition’s value is increasingly being measured by how the complex ties between the actors involved in northern and eastern Syria are managed. As of early 2025, the imprisonment of Islamic State prisoners remained one of the most sensitive questions for the coalition formed to fight the group. According to a March 2025 study by the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism, roughly 8,500 male Islamic State affiliates are being held across more than two-dozen SDF-run detention centers. Among them are 5,400 Syrians and 3,100 foreign nationals, including about 1,600 Iraqis. In parallel to the detention system are the massive camps that house the families of suspected Islamic State members. The two largest, Al-Hol and Roj, together hold an estimated 38,000 people, including some 23,000 foreign nationals, more than 60 percent of whom are children, most under the age of twelve. Their conditions remain dire: humanitarian access is limited, governance is precarious, and the camps have at times served as spaces of radicalization and informal justice. Amnesty International estimates that up to 46,500 people, the majority of whom are women and children, are being held across this network of camps and prisons, most without formal charges being leveled against them. The U.S. military presence that underwrites this fragile order has steadily contracted. As of late 2024, the Pentagon reported roughly 2,000 U.S. troops deployed in Syria under the Combined Joint Task Force–Operation Inherent Resolve mandate. While exact figures fluctuate, Washington has signaled its intention to reduce its forces, and did so in 2025, concentrating them in a handful of strategic sites around Hasakeh and Deir Ezzor Governorates. Thus far, the presence of these troops, though limited in number, remains critical for the maintenance of secure detention conditions, aerial surveillance, and the deterrence of a renewed Islamic State insurgency in Syria’s northeast. U.S. Domestic Attitudes Toward Intervention Overseas A second factor shaping Syria policy is the deepening skepticism in the United States toward foreign military interventions abroad. Trump’s return to office in 2025 only reinforced this trend. Within his administration, two broad camps are competing for influence. On the one side are advocates of restraint, who argue that Syria exemplifies one of the “forever wars” in regions that are peripheral to vital U.S. interests. Many of Trump’s close allies, including Vice President J. D. Vance and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, lean toward this view. Their arguments emphasize the drain on resources of such interventions, as well as the endless nature of entanglements in local rivalries, which leads to limited strategic payoffs. On the other side are national security hawks, such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Senator Lindsey Graham, who though not a member of the administration has the presidents’ ear and is a member of influential congressional committees, including the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. They warn that a U.S. withdrawal from Syria risks allowing a jihadi resurgence as well as renewed Iranian influence and Russian meddling. Their argument is that even a small U.S. footprint offers outsized benefits in terms of deterrence, intelligence gathering, and regional leverage. Trump treats these divisions less as a doctrinal matter than as bargaining leverage. His approach to Syria is transactional and shaped by regional alignments. The U.S. decision in May 2025 to lift some sanctions on the Sharaa government, taken partly at Saudi Arabia’s behest, illustrates this flexibility. Disengagement from Syria is not straightforward, but is folded into calculations over the possibility of normalization between Syria and Israel, an understanding between Türkiye and Iran in Syria, as well as Iran’s containment. In this light, the ongoing U.S. withdrawal from Syria is not a strategic pivot so much as the culmination of shifting priorities and domestic pressures. It reflects the exhaustion of the Islamic State mission, the transformation of Syria’s political landscape, and the influence of restraint-oriented voices in Washington. In November 2025, the United States took several steps toward engaging with the Damascus leadership under Sharaa. During the Syrian president’s visit to the White House (the first by a Syrian head of state), Washington announced that Syria would join the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State and that the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2019—U.S. legislation sanctioning the former Assad regime, but still in place—would be suspended for 180 days. The administration also confirmed that Syria would be allowed to reopen its embassy in Washington, restoring diplomatic relations for the first time since 2012. Sharaa, who until recently had been designated a global terrorist, was formally removed from U.S. sanctions list. Trump publicly endorsed the new Syrian leader, framing the relationship as the beginning of a “new era” of cooperation. Such cooperation notwithstanding, public opinion polls both reflect and help drive the Trump administration’s efforts to identify an appropriate framework for disengagement from Syria and the broader Middle East. A Pew Research Center survey conducted in March 2025 found that 52 percent of Americans believed it was better if the United States paid less attention to the affairs of other nations. This reflected broader doubts about military engagements, specifically in the Middle East. For instance, a Quinnipiac University poll conducted in June 2025 revealed that 51 percent of voters opposed the United States joining Israel in conducting military strikes against Iran’s nuclear sites, with 42 percent in favor. This reluctance is not necessarily rooted in isolationism but is often coupled with a heightened focus on countering China’s growing international influence. A July 2025 Chicago Council on Global Affairs survey indicated that, since 1998, when the council began polling attitudes toward critical threats to the United States and its interests, there has been a decline in the percentage of respondents who consider international terrorism a critical threat, even if 55 percent still regard it as such. Meanwhile, other issues have become more salient, including the emergence of China as a world power (50 percent) and the global economic downturn (49 percent). The historical context illuminates this shift. The conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, which together resulted in over 7,000 U.S. military deaths and cost trillions of dollars, left lasting impacts on public sentiment. They led to a reevaluation of U.S. military commitments, particularly in regions where critical U.S. national interests were not seen to be at stake. This is having a major effect on the Trump administration’s desire to ensure that its footprint in Syria remains very limited. The Tanf Garrison and U.S. Possibilities in Syria A third factor defining U.S. behavior in Syria is the establishment of the Tanf base in the country’s southeast, which the United States has transformed into a strategic asset. Established in 2016, the base sits astride the Baghdad-Damascus highway, once a vital Iranian supply route to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Tanf potentially allows the U.S. to monitor and disrupt Iranian logistics, protect Jordan from instability in Syria, and project surveillance and rapid-reaction capabilities across the volatile Syria-Iraq-Jordan triborder area. Though the Tanf garrison hosted fewer than 500 troops as of December 2024, its value far outweighs its size. As late as April 2025, the Americans were still training a small Syrian force there, now called Division 70 of the Syrian army. Together, the anti-Islamic State mission and presence in Tanf reflect Washington’s preference for a calibrated engagement in Syria, one that is security-focused and deliberately limited. This has allowed the United States to retain leverage in the country without becoming entangled in the details of political life or large-scale reconstruction. Such an attitude, in turn, has aligned with domestic pressures to minimize overseas commitments. These priorities continue to shape Washington’s attitudes toward Syria. However, the emergence of a new political order in Damascus, backed by Türkiye but opposed by the SDF and certain minority communities that feel threatened, has introduced a new triangular relationship overshadowing older concerns. The future of U.S. strategy in Syria, in particular the feasibility of a withdrawal from the country, will hinge on how successfully Washington manages this multifaceted arrangement. Reshaping the U.S. Security Model After the Assad Regime’s Collapse After 2014, the U.S. security model in eastern Syria relied on limited local partnerships, a network of small military outposts, and the presence of the Tanf base. This model served a dual purpose: containing the Islamic State and interdicting Iran’s land routes to Hezbollah across the Syrian desert. But with the collapse of the Assad regime, Iran’s exit from Syria, and the rollback of Russian involvement in the country, the continued pursuit of such an approach was both logistically and politically untenable. Washington now faces an entirely new geopolitical landscape, one defined by wide open spaces, not internal boundaries as during the Syrian conflict. What is in place is a fragmented security environment attractive to jihadi actors and characterized by fluid local alliances, all this overseen by a relatively new, institutionally weak, Syrian central authority. The Move Toward a New U.S. Security Order in Syria The U.S. security architecture in Syria after 2014 was, paradoxically, predicated on the continued existence of the Assad regime and the limited stabilizing, albeit also brutal, roles played by Russia and Iran. The United States, for its part, opted to operate from relatively secure zones on Syria’s geographical periphery, such as areas east of the Euphrates and at the Tanf base, while maintaining a military partnership with the SDF. Even as Washington supported local stabilization programs in select opposition-held areas, it did not commit to permanent governance or state-building efforts nationally. However, this model was never designed to withstand the changes that followed the regime’s collapse. After the partial U.S. withdrawal in 2018, triggered by Türkiye’s Operation Peace Spring, Washington’s room for maneuver has shrunk significantly. The political and strategic factors that had given the U.S. model its semblance of legitimacy, namely the Russian and Iranian presence in Syria, began to erode and the situation in the country has now radically shifted. Consequently, since Trump took office in January 2025, U.S. operations have been suspended at four bases, with overall troop levels falling to below 1,000 soldiers. The American military saw a transformation in its role from direct actor to mediator and observer. In this context, for the United States stability in eastern Syria depends on keeping three functions in balance: managing the detention, transfer, and repatriation of combatants mainly of the Islamic State group; ensuring the safe movement of people, goods, and services on key roads; and protecting sensitive sites, such as military and intelligence centers as well as detention sites for Islamic State militants, and energy facilities. If any one of these priorities breaks down, it may create spaces for a revival of the Islamic State, while also exacerbating regional tensions and local sensitivities. Indeed, Washington’s main goals are to ensure that nothing undermines the status quo in eastern Syria in a way that threatens U.S. interests, while it also seeks to prevent an Islamic State resurgence and ensure that local incidents do not escalate into broader conflagrations. This repositioning reflects a conscious shift from the previous static form of deterrence, meaning operations launched from permanent sites using fixed military capabilities, toward more flexible oversight, denoting a more dynamic U.S. posture emphasizing monitoring, deconfliction, and mediation among parties on the ground. The Americans in eastern Syria are redefining their role from that of a military guarantor to being a political broker, where they are now facilitating dialogue between the SDF and the new authorities in Damascus, as well as between Türkiye and the SDF. But what is needed is the careful construction of a more durable security model. It remains to be seen what this might look like, however, as the unraveling of the previous security order has opened the door to a volatile security environment in which actors old and new are now vying for influence. Since December, Syria has faced a new form of security fragmentation. Across the country’s now open geography, from the eastern desert to Raqqa to the southern border regions around Daraa and Suwayda, there are no longer lines of control. Absent a single actor able to manage competing factions or enforce coherent territorial boundaries, the political landscape has created potential spaces for jihadi mobilization, particularly among Islamic State remnants and unaffiliated militants seeking an opportunity to reemerge. The Islamic State has seized on this transformation, recalibrating its rhetoric and messaging. By mid-2025, Al-Naba’, one of the group’s official media outlets, was publishing weekly editorials targeting Sharaa, branding him a traitor and an apostate. Once a member of the Islamic State, Sharaa later led Jabhat al-Nusra, an earlier rendition of Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, a battlefield rival of the Islamic State in Deir Ezzor. He is now seen as the face of a new political order in Damascus, an outcome viewed by many jihadis as an ideological betrayal. The reason is that Sharaa has shifted from jihadi militancy to political leadership, which requires compromise and engagement with countries in the region—such as Türkiye and Saudi Arabia—and internationally. In response to Sharaa’s November visit to Washington and Syria’s formal declaration of joining the international coalition to fight the Islamic State, Islamic State media outlets framed the development as a betrayal of Sunni interests, arguing that Sharaa, like Türkiye under Mustapha Kemal Atatürk, had abandoned Islam and joined with the West, effectively becoming an instrument of an international order hostile to Islam. The group sought to delegitimize any Western-friendly Sunni political project in Syria, reserving all religious and ideological authority for itself. In contrast, Syrian Justice Minister Mazhar al-Wais, himself a former Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham member, defended Syria’s alignment with the coalition. He framed the agreement as a form of cooperation that strengthened Syrian state sovereignty and oversight while targeting the residual threat posed by the Islamic State, asserting that such coordination did not constitute military subordination to outside powers or a breach of religious law. For Türkiye, the primary objective in the northeast is to dismantle the military architecture of the SDF and ensure it is not normalized. A major component of the SDF is the Kurdish People’s Protection Units, or YPG, which Ankara regards as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which it considers a terrorist organization. The Turkish aim is to eliminate the PKK’s cross-border influence, integrate any residual SDF structures into Syria’s state security hierarchy, and preclude the emergence of a semi-autonomous security order. Turkish officials have signaled that the YPG’s eradication is their aim, and that Ankara will intervene to prevent any arrangement that preserves the group’s de facto autonomy, especially if diplomatic tracks stall. In practice, its calibrated strikes, pressure through Turkish-backed factions, and political efforts to influence the decisions of the Syrian government with regard to the SDF are all aimed at keeping the SDF’s leadership off balance, until a post-SDF security configuration can be put in place. The United States, in turn, treats Syria first and foremost as a counterterrorism sphere. Its immediate objective is to employ small but mobile U.S. forces to prevent the Islamic State from reviving, while at the same time keeping an eye on other jihadi groups, for example the Turkestan Islamic Party, made up of Uyghurs, which has ties to the current Syrian regime. This means participating in targeted raids against jihadis, dismantling active cells, in addition to other undertakings, such as engaging in routine deconfliction to prevent local incidents from escalating and creating an environment that allows the Islamic State in particular to reinforce itself. While the United States supports the idea of one Syrian nation, one army, and one government, it has been mainly focused on managing the situation on the ground and neutralizing threats, not in engaging in nation building or holding territory. This is a position that can be sustained even as the numbers of U.S. ground forces in Syria and Iraq continue to decline. One dimension of this counterterrorism concern is the detention and repatriation of Islamic State prisoners. U.S. Central Command, or CENTCOM, has announced a Joint Repatriation Cell in northeast Syria to speed lawful returns to home countries from Al-Hol and Roj and reduce the pool of prisoners who might pose a risk though their continued imprisonment. In parallel, the meeting between Sharaa and CENTCOM Commander Brad Cooper in September 2025 highlighted the existence of a practical channel for coordinating on the repatriation of displaced persons and detainees from Islamic State-controlled camps, as well as maintaining oversight of remaining threats from the group. This mechanism helps prevent security vacuums as the U.S. footprint in Syria decreases. U.S. actions are taking place in an atmosphere of instability across post-Assad Syria, driven primarily by sectarian violence. Pro-government armed factions and local coalitions have established de facto control in sections of the country’s coastal areas and in Suwayda, amid state weakness. These developments have reignited longstanding tensions and grievances, particularly among rural Sunnis who once formed the backbone of the Islamic State’s support base. The June 2025 suicide bombing at St. Elias Church in Damascus, carried out during mass, was emblematic of this escalation. It followed weeks of incitement on jihadi Telegram channels, which are increasingly stigmatizing Syria’s minority communities and accusing the Sharaa regime of protecting them in order to pander to Western countries. Similarly, in April–May 2025, fighting broke out between government-affiliated forces and Druze gunmen in the suburbs of Damascus before spreading to Suwayda, which led to Israeli intervention in defense of the Druze, an influential community inside Israel. Since then, there has been widespread mistrust of the government among the Druze, undermining short-term prospects for reconciliation. Meanwhile, the Arab-Kurdish relationship in eastern Syria has sparked renewed tensions. In October, clashes in the Kurdish-majority neighborhoods of Sheikh Maqsoud and Ashrafieh in Aleppo led to fighting between SDF-aligned security units and government forces, before Sharaa and the SDF commander Mazloum Abdi concluded a new truce, in the presence of the U.S. envoy to Syria and the commander of U.S. forces. Despite years of coordination between the SDF and the Americans, the gradual U.S. withdrawal and Washington’s attempts to facilitate the political incorporation of the SDF into the Syrian state within a formal reconciliation framework have revived old sensitivities. The August 8, 2025, Hasakeh Conference, organized by the SDF with the participation of minority communal representatives, presented a vision for a decentralized, democratic Syria, but was not welcomed by the authorities in Damascus. Kurdish leaders, in turn, fear that a reduction in U.S. backing will strip them of the gains they made after 2015 and leave them isolated in a political transition that they too profoundly distrust. Among the Arab tribes of Deir Ezzor and Raqqa, many feel they were used to support a Kurdish-led project that did not represent them. The rise of a governing structure with an Islamic character in Damascus, supported by Turkish influence in the north, has revived their fear of renewed marginalization under a new Syrian central authority. However, it has also heightened political ambitions among Sunni tribal elites, who see an opportunity to entrench their influence in Syria’s emerging security sector. Dozens of influential security officials hail from Deir Ezzor, and specifically from the Aqidat tribe and the town of Shuhail, a stronghold of Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham’s predecessor Jabhat al-Nusra. For example, Hussein al-Salama from Deir Ezzor, who is director of the General Intelligence Service, and Youssef al-Hijr, from Shuhail, who is the former head of Hay’at Tahir al-Sham’s Politburo and was named director of foreign affairs in the office of the foreign minister in May, hold sway over new security networks and are increasingly viewed as kingmakers. Ahrar al-Sharqiya, a Turkish-backed Syrian National Army faction rooted in Deir Ezzor’s tribal networks, has also become a central pillar in the military structures of the Syrian government. The faction originated as a tribal formation that then merged into a broader Islamist coalition, and it is now part of the Liberation and Construction Movement. Many tribal actors have come to see themselves, rightly or wrongly, as part of a new Syrian “deep state,” and this has increased Arab tribal mobilization against Kurdish political actors, raising the likelihood of open-ended cycles of communal violence. The fragility of the institutions of the Syrian state has exacerbated existing risks. Although Sharaa has become the state’s public face, the operative structures of governance remain deficient. The absence of vetting and accountability mechanisms has opened gateways for former jihadi elements to penetrate burgeoning security institutions, directly or through tribal intermediaries. This raises the possibility that the present Syrian state, intentionally or unintentionally, could become a channel for the reabsorption of extremist elements under a new political guise, through well-known social and tribal channels. This is similar to what happened during the years of Islamic State control, when local tribal populations were subjected to a centralized Islamic authority through tribal networks. A Tripartite Security Framework and its Vulnerabilities As the United States has moved toward a new security framework to replace the one that collapsed with the downfall of the Assad regime, it has dealt with the different actors in the east on the basis of their functions and limitations. The SDF is its operational anchor in containing the Islamic State: it collaborates with the United States in combating the group, detains prisoners, and helps to dismantle Islamic State cells. Türkiye-backed groups, in turn, have prioritized inhibiting the SDF, which has compelled the Americans to intervene and ensure that the ensuing tensions do not detract from containing the Islamic State. As for the Syrian regime, it seeks instruments of control and political recognition, and has allowed limited security coordination when it aligns with preventing an Islamic State resurgence. Washington has maintained an equilibrium within this uneasy triangle. Nor is this the only role the Americans are playing. In the Syria-Iraq-Jordan triborder area, the Tanf garrison is engaged in surveillance, the disruption of Islamic State cells, and the interdiction of infiltration attempts by these cells and by Iran-backed groups. The local U.S. partner, Maghawir al-Thawra (Commandos of the Revolution), organizes patrols and engages in quick-reaction tasks under tight rules of engagement, coordinating with Jordan and with U.S. deconfliction channels. The red lines imposed by the Americans are explicit, namely to protect personnel and sites of the anti-Islamic State coalition and prevent any cross-border threats into and from the area. In this way, Tanf complements the SDF’s role in the east and preserves the counterterrorism priority. Tanf also functions as a regional control node in the emerging security framework. The primary aim here is to monitor and prevent Iran-backed militias from using Iraqi territory to establish a logistical corridor across the Syrian desert toward the Jordanian border, the Golan Heights, and Lebanon. Therefore, for the United States and the coalition, Tanf coordinates in real time with Jordanian air defenses and engages in deconfliction with Baghdad. This effectively places the base outside any process of integration into the Syrian government’s command structure, linking it to regional interests. These interests are centered on border-security coordination involving Amman, Baghdad, Ankara, and the regime in Damascus, while Tanf provides the operational capacity to organize patrols, interdict hostile actions, and engage in rapid response actions. As a result, the base remains a vital hinge in the transition toward a new security framework in Syria, with its ability to deter and neutralize threats in the southeast, thereby filling a gap the Syrian government, the SDF, and Türkiye-backed forces cannot fill on their own. Complicating the picture, southern Syria is an arena in which Israel has enforced two conditions: demilitarization and protection of the Druze. This has yielded an environment that has restricted the Syrian government’s force posture and lowered the odds of a spillover of Syrian dynamics into Jordan and the occupied Golan Heights—allowing Washington to maintain its primary focus on the situation in eastern Syria. This transitional framework in Syria is, therefore, being defined by two broad forms of external constraints: Turkish pressure in the north to curb the SDF’s expansion and an Israeli ceiling in the south that has blocked the area’s remilitarization. Between the two, Washington has managed to accept Israel’s airstrikes in the south as a reality to be dealt with and pursue its balancing act in the east, while imposing enforceable rules of behavior in the latter built around three priorities: maintaining Islamic State detention facilities, keeping major roads open, and securing sensitive infrastructure. However, the tripartite arrangement in Syria’s east is characterized by structural constraints and intertwined risks. Turkish-Israeli competition has defined the limits of Türkiye’s and Israel’s influence. At the same time, the Syrian regime’s power structure, which is built on a narrow Sunni rural base and an Islamist ideology, might at any moment trigger identity-based mobilization. Over time, and in the absence of understandings between Türkiye and Israel, their rivalry will impede Syria’s transition process in two ways. First, it will perpetuate Turkish and Israeli spheres of influence—a Turkish north where movement and rules of engagement are set by Ankara and its factions; and an Israeli-dominated south structured by Israel’s conditions and its continued freedom to conduct military strikes. This will prevent the emergence of a national Syrian framework, through which the government can reimpose its authority throughout its territory. And it will mean that the situation in the east will continue to be characterized by conflict and division, therefore fragility, where ad hoc understandings rather than national institutions are employed to resolve issues. This will undercut security arrangements there, opening a window for an Islamic State resurgence, but more broadly, making the east a barometer of the fragmentation and rivalries nationally. That is why the effectiveness of the nascent security model in the east depends on a harmonization of Turkish and Israeli stakes in Syria—on aligning Israel’s declared freedom of action with Ankara’s red lines—as well as on Washington’s operational posture at Tanf. It also depends on the ability of the Syrian government and its local partners to deliver a consensual political transition in the country. However, Syrian state institutions have been depleted and day-to-day security often relies on short-term understandings. Sectarian tensions are rising, therefore the security test for the current government is straightforward. It involves preserving neutrality in enforcing security throughout the country and preventing mobilization of segments of society along identity lines. The reality, however, is that the authorities in Damascus, to fill gaps in professional policing, have relied on mobilizing combatants along ethnosectarian lines, in the guise of local auxiliaries, mostly made up of its Sunni supporters. The result has been to delegate control to these formations without a clear legal mandate, creating parallel lines of command. In the Suwayda clashes of July 2025, for example, this took the form of tribal call-ups of forces. Earlier, in March, when intense clashes along the Syrian coast escalated into attacks against civilian Alawite communities, the government’s mobilization of forces took place through mosques. The immediate outcome was that the authorities were not seen as being neutral, and there was no consistency in the orders passed down to units on the ground, allowing for violence against segments of the population. This had a very damaging impact on social cohesion. If this pattern is replicated in the east through tribal mobilization against the Kurds, the security triptych there—detention, road protection, and site protection—will be degraded, allowing adversaries of the government to regain the initiative. If security is based on group loyalty rather than laws applicable to all, the outcome invariably will undermine Syria’s transition and reinforce fragmentation. In such a tenuous environment, eastern Syria remains the principal place where local shocks have the capacity to cause regional spillover. Any failing, such as an uprising inside a detention facility, a confrontation between Kurdish and Arab communities, or a breakdown in guarding critical stretches of roads, raises the likelihood of spreading and even encouraging cross-border intervention. The two most likely parties exploiting such a situation are Türkiye and Iran. On the Turkish side, Ankara’s hostility to the SDF’s expansion could lead to Turkish strikes, the disruption of operating hours at border crossings or of the passage of humanitarian convoys, and looser discipline among local Arab Sunnis along and around the M4 highway stretching from Aleppo to Raqqa and beyond. As for Iran, it could seek to exploit instability by using its Iraqi allies to take advantage of reduced Syrian control over the Qa’im-Bukamal corridor. This, in turn, would create more room to maneuver for Iraqi militias familiar with the geography of the area stretching from Anbar Governorate in Iraq to the eastern desert in Syria, known as the Badia, allowing the Iranians to regain a foothold in the country. And as a result, this could also provoke an Israeli response that leads to regional hostilities. In practical terms, anything that diverts attention in eastern Syria away from counterterrorism and escalates clashes among communities because of identity questions, sectarian or ethnic, would recreate the conditions in place prior to 2013. At the time, the Badia was easily traversable, the infrastructure for detaining jihadi prisoners was limited and subject to breaches, and groups tended to be activated based on a perception of group threat. Replicating such an environment today would facilitate the revival of jihadi groups in a more decentralized context, only reinforcing the need to guard against any undermining of the three security priorities mentioned earlier. All parties acknowledge the risks, but U.S. policy in eastern Syria focuses on keeping them in check. Two tracks run in parallel. Track one involves the ties between the SDF and Damascus and includes pilot security understanding to integrate and cooperate on specific matters. Track two is a working template among the Syrian authorities, Türkiye, and the SDF to lock in measurable “small packages.” These include formulating clear detention protocols, protecting specific road segments, and establishing mechanisms for deconfliction of tensions in the area. The United States can mediate between Damascus, the SDF, and Türkiye, but it cannot police daily compliance. The behavior of the parties at checkpoints, the discipline of units on the ground, sensitivities at the village and tribal levels, and the neutrality of government forces in enforcing decisions all play out locally, and local calculations usually prevail over top-down decisions coming from Damascus. In the end, dynamics at the local level will determine whether the model in place survives and can be consolidated. These local dynamics will unfold between two fixed security zones: a Turkish-managed north, including the M4 corridor, and an Israeli-monitored south where the freedom to attack is maintained. For as long as these two zones of influence are in conflict, the government in Damascus will be unable to unify Syria under its authority, while this situation will only ensure that fragmentation persists in the east, with the likelihood that the region will remain a zone of tension. That is why four elements are necessary for the parties to maintain a balance in eastern Syria and a measure of stability: a unified hierarchy of command down to the lowest levels; professional, non-selective practices at checkpoints; rapid accountability that imposes visible costs for violations; and early-warning channels linking local police to known coordination hubs. Where these elements do not exist, control will tend to revert to forces mobilized in an ad hoc manner that can morph into identity-based conflicts creating spaces for a variety of actors to threaten Syria’s stability: the Islamic State, Iran and its allies, Türkiye, and Israel, among others. Conclusion The collapse of the Assad regime in December 2024 ushered in a period of uncertainty in Syria, where the old U.S. security architecture—built around containing and degrading the Islamic State and maintaining a presence at the Tanf base—was no longer viable. In its place, a pragmatic, tripartite arrangement is emerging, centered on the authorities in Damascus, Turkish-backed structures in the north, and the SDF east of the Euphrates. It remains to be seen whether this arrangement will create a unified security order, but it has managed risk, reduced friction, and maintained essential operating norms in competing zones of control. Washington’s approach has reflected this reality. The Americans have been involved in low-cost mediation, targeted deterrence, and incremental, measurable interventions, which they have prioritized over institution-building or sponsoring a comprehensive Syrian political settlement. Integrating the Syrian government into the anti-Islamic State coalition also provides an opportunity to assess the government’s capacity to manage security and maintain territorial stability. Success depends less on external power projection and more on local execution, such as neutral enforcement of decisions at checkpoints, adherence to detention protocols, and the continuity of critical services. The most acute risks remain sectarian mobilization, tribal and communal disputes, and gaps in security oversight, particularly in the east, where small lapses could trigger broader instability and facilitate a jihadi resurgence.",0.040326748233207,0.3451809697355351,neutral,"{'neg': 0.085, 'neu': 0.807, 'pos': 0.108, 'compound': 0.999}",positive
https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/09/nepal-gen-z-topple-government?lang=en,Rethinking Power-Sharing Agreements in Libya,"Introduction

On August 21, Hanna Tetteh, head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) and special representative of the secretary-general, presented to the United Nations Security Council a new roadmap aimed at breaking Libya’s persistent political deadlock. Focused on reviving the electoral process and legitimizing institutions, the new UN initiative aims to create the conditions for a unified Libyan state. Yet the plan is likely to suffer the same fate as those of its predecessors, all of which sought to introduce power-sharing mechanisms in an attempt to resolve conflicts among Libyan factions. This approach is supposed to guarantee each political or security actor a place in the main power structures and bring an end to the country’s fragmentation. In practice, however, the consociationalist model of establishing a power-sharing interim government gives the elites that are its constituent elements veto power over most major decisions. This reinforces rivalries, deepens corruption, and can even scuttle the intended transition to democracy.

Essentially, the various initiatives undertaken by UNSMIL serve to highlight the limits of the power-sharing approach, at least insofar as it is focused on elites. It is time to rethink the framework. Rather than seeking to bring the major actors together around a fragile and constantly renegotiated system of agreements, UNSMIL should reassess its approach so that consensus becomes the eventual goal, as opposed to a procedural matter that comes up at every turn. And in order to prevent repeated deadlocks and address the structural and contextual challenges at play, UNSMIL should advocate for mediation frameworks that move beyond bargaining among elites. This can be done by managing temporality, given that the timetable for any process is all-important; cultivating ripeness, so that a final settlement is proposed only when all parties are ready for it; and seizing any and all major opportunities to resolve the conflict.

UNSMIL’s Structural Limitations

For nearly a decade, Libya has been marked by deep institutional division: a government executive based in Tripoli; and a House of Representatives based in Tobruk. This fragmentation of power has fueled a lasting crisis of legitimacy, hindering the reconstruction of the state and the unification of the country. While both institutions are internationally recognized, the House of Representatives has withdrawn its confidence in successive governments in Tripoli, granting it instead to rival bodies that it has appointed itself. The proliferation of armed groups—some of which act as proxies for external powers—and their control of territory have made the ruling elites dependent on them. While successive Tripoli-based governments have had to negotiate their authority with the Tripoli militias, the House of Representatives is allied with Marshal Khalifa Haftar’s self-proclaimed Libyan National Army (LNA).

Since 2015, UNSMIL has repeatedly indicated a preference for a power-sharing approach to reconcile the two sides, and has pushed for the establishment of a transitional government that would unify the country and hold free and fair elections. However, examination of the major UNSMIL-brokered accords, whether the Libyan Political Agreement (LPA) in 2015 or the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum (LPDF) in 2020, reveals that this consensus-based approach was flawed from the beginning.

In 2015, the LPA established a Presidential Council, to be made up of three members based on representation from Libya’s three main regions (Tripolitania, Cyrenaica, and Fezzan), and tasked it with forming a government of national accord. Despite sending representatives to the negotiations, the House of Representatives ultimately refused to grant its confidence to this new government, as it disagreed with provisions regarding the distribution of powers as well as certain military-related issues. Furthermore, the consensus on the composition of the council fractured, as various parties sought representation within the power-sharing model. Ultimately the Presidential Council was undermined by rivalries among elites and no longer fairly represented the country’s three regions despite being expanded to nine members.

In 2019, the internationalization of the Libyan conflict resulted in the active involvement of the Wagner Group—a Russian private military company with strong ties to the Russian state that existed from 2014 until 2023—alongside LNA units, and the deployment of Turkish forces to support the government of national accord in Tripoli. In 2020, UNSMIL initiated “outside-in” mediation within the framework of the Berlin process, a series of diplomatic initiatives to revive Libyan inter-dialogue. By including foreign powers in mediation and resolution efforts, the Berlin process made it possible to negotiate a ceasefire in October of that year. Paradoxically, the continued presence of foreign forces had ensured a balance of power among the Libyan elites and therefore an acceptable status quo.

The Libyan Political Dialogue Forum (LPDF), launched by UNSMIL after the 2020 ceasefire, was conceived as a more inclusive mediation framework. The LPDF brought together members of the main rival institutions but also, more importantly, created a broad representation of Libyan society: women, youth, civil society, and political parties were included in order to increase the legitimacy of the process. At the same time, consultations and initiatives on security and economic issues were launched to complement the political component. At the end of these discussions, the seventy-five Libyan participants in the LPDF designated a list of three members (one each for Tripolitania, Cyrenaica, and Fezzan) to form the new Presidential Council, as well as a prime minister to steer the country toward elections.

However, the subsequent national unity government—formed in Tripoli in March 2021—proved unable to overcome the transactional logic of the elites and the persistent problem of corruption. Similarly, it failed to resolve the sticking points that served as an excuse for local and international “spoilers” to prevent change. Unresolved debates over electoral laws, eligibility to run in elections, and constitutional amendments have allowed dominant groups to preserve their advantages and prevent the emergence of new political figures and the implementation of reforms, as well as to block presidential and legislative elections that had been set by UNSMIL for December 24, 2021. Instead of the durable pact among elites envisioned by the power-sharing framework, bargaining among those very elites became the order of the day.

How to Benefit from Temporality, Ripeness, and Opportunities

Although the roadmaps proposed by UNSMIL have often been perceived as failures in the immediate sense, they have helped to create space for dialogue and established methodological frameworks that continue to offer hope for the evolution of the Libyan political process. The problem lies in continuing uncertainty about the medium and long-term sustainability of these roadmaps. Considering this uncertainty, mediation efforts should leverage three strategic tools to strengthen the consolidation of any roadmaps: temporality, ripeness, and opportunities.

Tinkering with Temporality

The issue of temporality is central to the success of the political mediation processes led by UNSMIL. The latter has historically favored tight schedules for the implementation of its plans. In part, this is due to the short-term nature of UNSMIL’s mandate. For example, its most recent mandate was renewed in October 2025 for one year by the UNSC under Resolution 2796. While a tight schedule can prevent certain blockages, such as the ability of “spoilers” to undermine the political transition, it risks fueling a short-term crisis management approach, one that is based on stabilization rather than long-term resolution.

UNSMIL’s latest roadmap sets out the goal of unifying institutions and organizing national elections within twelve to eighteen months. Yet the Libyan experience shows that tight timelines are largely illusory and frequently exceeded due to persistent disagreements, ambiguities in the text of agreements, and competing interests related to the nature of power-sharing. Ultimately, failure to adhere to timetables further erodes the legitimacy of interim institutions and fuels accusations of illegitimacy. Faced with this impasse, it would be wise to alter the process in favor of an incremental, long-term approach to agreements.

Such an approach would enable stakeholders to gain greater confidence in each other as well as in the power-sharing framework itself. This could allow for more extensive oversight of reforms. The latter could include decentralization—which has already been identified by several researchers as an effective practice in Libya, and which enables a more accurate representation of local realities. For example, although the state has failed to fulfil several of its duties since 2011, municipalities have on several occasions proven able to guarantee security, ceasefires, elections, and access to certain services for the population. From an economic perspective, it is necessary to consider implementing reforms aimed at the redistribution of hydrocarbon revenues. This could facilitate a better distribution of wealth and, in the long term, strengthen local governance.

Cultivating Ripeness

The repeated failure of transition processes in Libya, particularly when it comes to the sustainability of compromises among elites, often reveals that proposed all-encompassing agreements have not had time to ripen. Yet this maturation is crucial to the success of the undertaking. To paraphrase William Zartman, renowned American researcher of and expert in conflict resolution, the ripeness of a proposed settlement must be nurtured by the mediating party in any conflict. In the case of Libya, the onus is on UNSMIL to do this by establishing a rigorous framework for any roadmap or agreement, one that would create space for dialogue among opposing parties, and, even more importantly, clear up ambiguities fully or at least partially.

The resumption of negotiations among the 6+6 Committee—composed of members of the House of Representatives and its rival claimant to the upper house of parliament, the High Supreme Council—is a step in the right direction. Tasked with reaching an agreement to revise the constitutional framework governing the electoral process, the body is supported by the recommendations and co-supervision of an Advisory Committee composed of twenty Libyan experts, in accordance with UNSC Resolution 2755 (2024). This format requires their members to work together on technical aspects of the constitution and elections. However, reaching solid compromises takes time, and the 6+6 members are struggling to achieve their mission.

For it to reach a sufficient degree of ripeness, any framework must elicit participation by a wide segment of the Libyan population. This would ensure more transparent and representative negotiations as well as political openness, and would limit the exclusion of minority groups. UNSMIL head Tetteh plans to resume and strengthen the inclusive initiatives already implemented within the framework of the ongoing National Dialogue and the LPDF by proposing the establishment of a Structured Dialogue platform. This would include representatives of civil society, municipalities, political parties, and security actors, and would guarantee the representation of women and certain geographic and cultural groups.

With the primary objective of laying the groundwork for a clear national vision and overseeing the constitutional process, the Structured Dialogue platform could help to limit the so-called kingmaking ability of elites. For one thing, including members of civil society within future bodies would facilitate a cyclical replacement of elites before each and every round of elections. And, for another, it would help see to it that authority over several matters devolves to grassroots civil society individuals and groups. This would counterbalance the traditional arrangements observed among elites, which restrict access to those beyond their circle.

Seizing Opportunities

Since its inception, UNSMIL has faced constant disruptions due to external interference that has competed with and undermined its mission. Despite UNSMIL representatives’ efforts to petition the UNSC to sanction those who obstruct the process—whether Libyan or foreign—the effectiveness of any such proposed measures remains uncertain due to structural divisions and persistent conflicting interests within the Security Council regarding the Libyan issue. In the conclusion of her book recounting her years as a former UNSMIL representative, Stephanie Williams examines the profound transformations currently taking place in peacemaking processes: “Will conflict negotiations be taken up by the relevant regional organizations or individual, interested member states? Or by private mediation organizations? Are there other formulas that can be pursued?” In setting out a remedial course of action, Williams argues that UN mediators must position themselves as “conductors” who define the framework and lead the process, rather than restricting themselves to the role of “soloists” who guide it from the background.

While it is essential to maintain a multilateral approach to negotiations for conflict resolution, UNSMIL could take advantage of the opportunities presented by the strategic ambitions of external actors. These ambitions may serve to incentivize such actors to resolve the conflict. Take, for example, the peace agreement that was concluded in September 2025 between the national unity government and Tripoli’s Rada militia, which controls Mitiga Airport. Türkiye’s support for the agreement illustrated how external economic and security interests could promote the establishment of new mediation arrangements in parallel with traditional efforts.

The U.S. desire to play a more active role in resolving the Libyan conflict could emerge as similarly constructive. This was demonstrated by the Rome meeting in September 2025 between Massad Boulos, senior advisor for African affairs in the Trump administration, and two powerful Libyan figures linked to opposing forces from the east and west. The meeting reportedly focused on how to draw up a unified budget among rival institutions to promote the country’s openness to commercial opportunities.

A separate U.S. initiative to merge segments of the armed forces of eastern and western Libya—as part of U.S. Africa Command’s annual Flintlock special operations exercise—could also present an opportunity to resolve the conflict. This initiative could be conducted in coordination with, rather than in competition with, UNSMIL’s efforts to establish a Joint Technical Coordination Team that brings together security groups from the west and east in joint exercises. For their part, by engaging in initiatives that enable them to take on recognized institutional roles with international mediators and partners, key Libyan actors could well find it in their interest to end the various conflicts among their respective factions.

Conclusion

External actors, particularly those invested in Libyan affairs, already feel tempted to double as “dealmakers” in Libya. This phenomenon, if properly harnessed by UNSMIL, can help to resolve the conflict. However, it is important not to grant these outside powers a blank check; instead, UNSMIL and Libyan actors themselves should place limits on their prerogatives. Otherwise, as seen in the mediation process with the Palestinians in Gaza, there is a risk that foreign powers will shunt aside the concerns and aspirations of the people on the ground.",https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/12/rethinking-power-sharing-agreements-in-libya?lang=en&center=middle-east,,"Introduction On August 21, Hanna Tetteh, head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) and special representative of the secretary-general, presented to the United Nations Security Council a new roadmap aimed at breaking Libya’s persistent political deadlock. Focused on reviving the electoral process and legitimizing institutions, the new UN initiative aims to create the conditions for a unified Libyan state. Yet the plan is likely to suffer the same fate as those of its predecessors, all of which sought to introduce power-sharing mechanisms in an attempt to resolve conflicts among Libyan factions. This approach is supposed to guarantee each political or security actor a place in the main power structures and bring an end to the country’s fragmentation. In practice, however, the consociationalist model of establishing a power-sharing interim government gives the elites that are its constituent elements veto power over most major decisions. This reinforces rivalries, deepens corruption, and can even scuttle the intended transition to democracy. Essentially, the various initiatives undertaken by UNSMIL serve to highlight the limits of the power-sharing approach, at least insofar as it is focused on elites. It is time to rethink the framework. Rather than seeking to bring the major actors together around a fragile and constantly renegotiated system of agreements, UNSMIL should reassess its approach so that consensus becomes the eventual goal, as opposed to a procedural matter that comes up at every turn. And in order to prevent repeated deadlocks and address the structural and contextual challenges at play, UNSMIL should advocate for mediation frameworks that move beyond bargaining among elites. This can be done by managing temporality, given that the timetable for any process is all-important; cultivating ripeness, so that a final settlement is proposed only when all parties are ready for it; and seizing any and all major opportunities to resolve the conflict. UNSMIL’s Structural Limitations For nearly a decade, Libya has been marked by deep institutional division: a government executive based in Tripoli; and a House of Representatives based in Tobruk. This fragmentation of power has fueled a lasting crisis of legitimacy, hindering the reconstruction of the state and the unification of the country. While both institutions are internationally recognized, the House of Representatives has withdrawn its confidence in successive governments in Tripoli, granting it instead to rival bodies that it has appointed itself. The proliferation of armed groups—some of which act as proxies for external powers—and their control of territory have made the ruling elites dependent on them. While successive Tripoli-based governments have had to negotiate their authority with the Tripoli militias, the House of Representatives is allied with Marshal Khalifa Haftar’s self-proclaimed Libyan National Army (LNA). Since 2015, UNSMIL has repeatedly indicated a preference for a power-sharing approach to reconcile the two sides, and has pushed for the establishment of a transitional government that would unify the country and hold free and fair elections. However, examination of the major UNSMIL-brokered accords, whether the Libyan Political Agreement (LPA) in 2015 or the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum (LPDF) in 2020, reveals that this consensus-based approach was flawed from the beginning. In 2015, the LPA established a Presidential Council, to be made up of three members based on representation from Libya’s three main regions (Tripolitania, Cyrenaica, and Fezzan), and tasked it with forming a government of national accord. Despite sending representatives to the negotiations, the House of Representatives ultimately refused to grant its confidence to this new government, as it disagreed with provisions regarding the distribution of powers as well as certain military-related issues. Furthermore, the consensus on the composition of the council fractured, as various parties sought representation within the power-sharing model. Ultimately the Presidential Council was undermined by rivalries among elites and no longer fairly represented the country’s three regions despite being expanded to nine members. In 2019, the internationalization of the Libyan conflict resulted in the active involvement of the Wagner Group—a Russian private military company with strong ties to the Russian state that existed from 2014 until 2023—alongside LNA units, and the deployment of Turkish forces to support the government of national accord in Tripoli.

This ban would’ve greatly impacted the citizens of Nepal because there was data that shows 55% of people that live in Nepal use social media on a daily basis. On September 6, the citizens reacted by using VPN (Virtual Private Network), protesting on Instagram by stating how the country is corrupted and showing their anger on the prohibition of social platforms.



The community started their protest on September 8, located in Kathmandu, Nepal. The protester had 160,000 members. The police forces were armed with live rounds and tear gas which was used to suppress the protesters and protesters, whom were throwing back tear gas at the officers while holding up an UNO reverse card to reference the UNO reverse card meme.

The 34-year-old Democratic Socialist, and state assemblyman, Mamdani became the winner of the Democratic primary and then the general election. The election brought about the highest turnout of voters since 1969. He went from a quite unknown person to a celebrated figure. His victory, which was powered by a platform that New York was not affordable anymore for its people, was also a breakthrough for the progressive politics focusing on economic inequality in the city. His ideas, among which are universal childcare, free buses for everyone, and a rent freeze, have caused such an uproar that the discussions are all about what is possible and what is necessary for New York’s future, with different opinions about it.

Hand in hand with the election of Mamdani, a new type of city management has been opened up. In the past, such a thinking would be unthinkable. New York has always been an icon of tough economic conditions, and its government has taken a soft approach towards the social issues that came with it, i.e. poverty, homelessness etc. But the era of such indirect confrontation with urban problems seems to be over. The new mayor’s proposal includes:

Key Policy Promises and Proposals:

Central to Mamdani’s campaign was the direct confrontation of the costly living situation in the city through a series of policies. The proposals serve to exploit the might of the municipal government to put up a better-off social safety net, that will be heavily tax-based on the wealthiest of individuals and corporations.

Universal Childcare:

Possibly the most important point of his platform, Mamdani has suggested that free and universal childcare should be offered for every child in New York City from six weeks to five years old. New Yorkers pay almost 26,000 a year for childcare on average. The purpose of the policy is to remove a great financial burden from families. Furthermore, the plan is also going to give a considerable increase in the salaries for caretakers, making them equal to the ones in public schools, thus, also addressing poor pay in the industry. This program would mainly depend on the taxing of high earners and large corporations.

Free Bus Service and Public Transit:

Mamdani has vowed to make all the city buses free of charge, thus extending a trial run in the pandemic times. He advocates for the free buses, along with the setting up of more bus lanes and their quick service, to be the main ingredients of the transportation system that has been made more just and efficient. Just like his child care proposal, this one will also be financed with the help of corporate tax hikes and income tax on citizens earning more than a million dollars a year.

Housing Affordability and Rent Freezes:

Mamdani is tackling the rental crisis in the city with the plan to freeze rents on one million units that are covered by rent stabilization. He claims to do thorough the Rent Guidelines Board and have members prevent any increases in rent. Besides this, he will have the city build three times more affordable homes than it does now.

City-Run Grocery Stores:

One of the most controversial propositions of his is the idea of five government-subsidized grocery stores, one in each borough. The new mayor calls it a, “public option for produce,” and he claims that it will be a way out of the problem of increasing food prices. Critics are saying that the plan is reminiscent of Soviet-style rationing, while supporters are referring to the examples of Istanbul and Chicago where similar models have worked.

Funding Mechanism

Taxing the Wealthy:

A considerable rise in taxes on the rich and corporations is the main source of financing these ambitious proposals. Mamdani has suggested a uniform 2% income tax hike for New Yorkers whose annual income exceeds one million dollars and an increase in the corporate tax rate from 9% to 11.5%. He estimates that the city could make $5 billion extra every year through this.

Allegations and Controversies

Mamdani’s rapid ascent to power has been a matter of keen interest and discussion, and the skeptics have not only focused on his integrity but also pointed out that some of his statements might provoke division.

The Rent-Stabilized Apartment Controversy:

One of the major hooks with which to criticize Mamdani has been his decision to occupy a rent-stabilized apartment in Astoria at the price of $2,300 per month, while holding a $142,000 salary as an assemblyman and being part of a wealthy family. His opponents argue that it is a clear case of misallocation of a housing resource aimed at low to middle-income New Yorkers. Mamdani has been subjected to extensive criticism, which even led former Governor Andrew Cuomo to propose a measure known as, “Zohran’s Law,” that would set income restrictions on such units, and he has promised to vacate the apartment.

Symbolic Missteps and Community Relations:

The use of incendiary terms and gestures by Mamdani has brought about adverse reactions. His “globalize the intifada” allusion, among others, has received disapproval and branded some as unhelpful or even antisemitic. Moreover, the outbursts of the Italian-American heritage groups were a consequence of a tweet where Mamdani was pictured giving a middle finger to Christopher Columbus’ statue, thus making the charge of cultural insensitivity against him even stronger.

Geopolitical Stances:

In the realm of geopolitical issues, the remark by Mamdani that he would have the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrested according to the ICC’s warrant, therefore aligning the city with “international law,” created a furor. His claims have only reinforced the perception of him being a politician brave enough to wade into the thickest controversies.

The “Unrealistic” Label: Pragmatism or Fantasy?

As always, the question of the realist or idealist side of Mamdani’s proposals and the discussion surrounding it, whether practically manageable or not, lies at the root of the matter.

The Legal and Political Hurdles:

Controversially the most practical issue is that certain features of Mamdani’s proposal, particularly the tax actions, are not completely under the control of a mayor. There is a need for state legislature approval and the governor’s consent. Kathy Hochul, the governor who endorsed Mamdani, has been clear in her opposition to the raising of the taxes on the wealthy by declaring, “I don’t want to lose any more people to Palm Beach. We’ve lost enough.” This creates the conditions for a possible political stalemate in Albany.

International and Historical Precedents:

A lot of Mamdani’s suggestions are criticized and labeled as “unrealistic” but these ideas are usual policies in many places around the globe. A European opinion stated, “He promised things that Europeans take for granted.” Free or heavily subsidized daycare is a common practice in the Nordic countries and in cities like Berlin. The no-fare public transport has already been installed in Estonia’s capital Tallinn and in Luxembourg. In fact, rent stabilization has been a part of New York’s recent history where it has been done four times during Mayor Bill de Blasio’s period. The grocery store project run by the city has been a political and social success in Istanbul, creating a core voter base among the working-class through their enduring loyalty.

The Campaign Finance Model:

An important element that played a huge role in Mamdani’s triumph was New York City’s public campaign finance system, though it is not usually mentioned. The system, which combines small donations and public funds, helped Mamdani to have a total of nearly $13 million, while at the same time oligarchs had spent dozens of millions on his opponents like Andrew Cuomo. This enabled him to perform a competitive, policy-driven campaign without turning to big corporate sponsors, thus demonstrating that a candidate with a similar stance could not only but also gain the support needed to win.

Is Zohran Mamdani the Right Fit for Modern NYC?

The issue of whether Zohran Mamdani is the right candidate for New York City is really about the city’s identity and future direction. His victory is a clear indicator of a system pushed to its limit where record bonuses on Wall Street are hotly debated amidst the ongoing affordable housing crisis for the common man.

For those who back him, Mamdani is just the fearless and courageous leader modern New York needs. He makes a point of difference from what they regard as past austerity politics, which have completely failed. He has given a clear and practical solution to the daily problems of New Yorkers who are suffering with the high cost of childcare, unreliable public transport, and the fear of not being able to afford their own homes. The international examples of his policies indicate that they are not radical fantasies but proven tools of social welfare that could turn New York into a more humane and livable city.

On the other hand, the critics of Mamdani, who include influential business, fear that his measures will slow down the economy and hence will lead to a retraction of public and private investments, besides causing a budget crisis as a result of a huge public debt. His political challenges are huge, and they make the prospect of a city government that is stagnant and gridlocked even more likely.

Mamdani’s New York City mayorship will serve as a real-life experiment for a new urban populism in America, to be continued or halted depending on Zohran Mamdani’s capacity to play the political game wisely and to build coalitions that will ultimately lead to the realization of the promised benefits for the residents of New York through tangible improvements. He has already successfully changed the political conversation in New York, and now, it will be the city and the world that will see if he can also change its reality.",https://www.thenewdealer.org/clubs/2025/12/02/zohran-mamdanis-victory-sparks-debate-over-new-york-citys-future/,2025-12-02 00:00:00,"The election of Zohran Mamdani as Mayor of New York City has been a real political turnaround for the city.

It is even harder to process how much work we have completed, how many new things we have learned, how many people we have met, and how many important lessons have shaped who we are now. What I never expected was that the increasing difficulty of school would create a feeling of resentment toward the work and eventually turn many of us into complete burnouts. I know I am not alone in that.

Senior year has tested all of us. Managing the SATs, college applications, extracurriculars, jobs, and a full load of classes is anything but easy. It becomes tempting to simply give up and tell yourself that you do not want to try anymore. That feeling is universal and valid, yet following it does not help us in the long run and does not build good habits.

Burnout often appears after long periods of stress when we do not even recognize how much we are carrying. Once we do notice it, the exhaustion can feel heavier than everything that caused it. Many of us respond by wanting to disconnect from everything around us and escape into endless scrolling, comfort food, or long days spent in bed. It’s important to remember that there are healthier ways to respond to stress and moments of burnout. Knowing how to care for yourself during these times can make all the difference as we move through the rest of senior year and into the next stage of life.

You will notice burnout when you have no desire for anything, when you feel tired even after a full night of sleep, when you are not curious about learning new things, and when you zone out and cannot stay focused. Here are some things you can do when you feel burnt out.

Do things that make you happy. Whether it is watching a show or hanging out with your friends, make time for something that brightens your week. Good moments are memorable and they take up more space in your mind than you realize.

Exercise. Even though it might sound like a chore, it can actually help a lot. Staying active can clear your mind and relieve stress in your body. There are so many ways to exercise whether it is wrestling, weight training, pilates, or riding a bike. There is so much room for adventure and trying new things.

Eat good food. Your diet affects your whole day. When you eat junk, you will feel like it. You might feel tired or irritated because those foods are not filling or energizing. Try to include food with protein, fiber, and vitamins to keep your energy and motivation steady.

To avoid exhaustion, it helps to switch up your work habits. Manage your time and try not to do everything at the last minute even if the assignment seems easy. If it is easy, get it out of the way. See how changing your mindset makes such a difference? Try to find things that make studying feel enjoyable, especially when your motivation is low. You could try a new coffee shop or a new study space. You could reward yourself with baking brownies, watching a show, or hanging out with friends once you finish your work. Anything that pushes you to keep going makes a difference. Do not give up. If you need a break, take one. Even if that means doing nothing for a day. Come back stronger. As someone who struggles with burnout, I realized that a lot of my stress comes from not doing my work in a timely way. It is important to be honest with ourselves so we can improve.

Even though I want all of us to keep pushing, remember to give yourself credit. You have worked hard. Be proud of that. Recognizing your effort and achievements can help you find the motivation to keep going. If you are burnt out, I hope this helped you and I wish you the best!",https://www.thenewdealer.org/clubs/2025/12/02/senior-burnout/,2025-12-02 00:00:00,"As a senior, it feels unbelievable to recognize how quickly high school has passed.

https://www.thenewdealer.org/reviews/2025/10/08/nepals-social-media-elects-their-prime-minister-through-discord/,College Application Stress Reaches New Heights,"As application season enters full swing, high school seniors across the country report that the college admissions process feels more overwhelming than ever. From juggling multiple essays to navigating financial aid forms, many students say the experience has become a demanding and often draining part of their senior year.

Over the past few decades, college admissions have transformed dramatically. In the 1980s and 1990s, most schools required a simple application. Today, students face a far more demanding checklist: personal statements, activity lists, multiple supplemental essays, recommendation letters, test scores, interviews, portfolios, and financial aid paperwork. Many colleges have also seen application numbers skyrocket, pushing acceptance rates downward and intensifying pressure on applicants.

Guidance counselors note that the process has gradually grown more complex over the past two decades. Colleges that once required a single personal statement now ask for several supplemental essays, each tailored to their specific programs and values. Students also apply to more schools than in previous generations, a trend fueled by lower acceptance rates and increased competition.

The Common App enables students to apply to more schools, colleges seeking larger applicant pools, and increased competition among universities to boost selectivity. As a result, students are encouraged to apply to more colleges than ever before, which in turn creates more work and more stress.

Families are also under increasing financial pressure as tuition costs rise and financial aid formulas grow more complicated. Many parents and students report confusion navigating the FAFSA, CSS Profile, and scholarship applications, which often require extensive tax documentation and strict adherence to deadlines. This financial component adds another layer of anxiety to an already demanding process.

Despite the challenges, educators emphasize that the process, while difficult, can also offer valuable opportunities for self-reflection and growth. Many students report gaining a deeper understanding of their goals, strengths, and motivations as they navigate the demands of the application season.

From juggling multiple essays to navigating financial aid forms, many students say the experience has become a demanding and often draining part of their senior year. Over the past few decades, college admissions have transformed dramatically. In the 1980s and 1990s, most schools required a simple application. Today, students face a far more demanding checklist: personal statements, activity lists, multiple supplemental essays, recommendation letters, test scores, interviews, portfolios, and financial aid paperwork. Many colleges have also seen application numbers skyrocket, pushing acceptance rates downward and intensifying pressure on applicants. Guidance counselors note that the process has gradually grown more complex over the past two decades. Colleges that once required a single personal statement now ask for several supplemental essays, each tailored to their specific programs and values. Students also apply to more schools than in previous generations, a trend fueled by lower acceptance rates and increased competition.

The rise of youth individualism has dramatically increased, with changes including the way they dress, talk, and identify themselves. This is what separates the youth from the older generation.

Influence of the digital world

The rise of social media has allowed access to a wide range of media where youth could discover new ideas and communities, or they could spread their own idea through creation, art, beliefs, or small businesses. While the internet creates opportunities for ideas, it also pressures people to compare themselves to others by trying to be too different. At some point it’s not you, it’s your online identity that the youth tries to become due to unrealistic expectations they have set for themselves, or by others they see on social media.

The 3 groups of internet individualism diseases that youth can contract

First, we have the “niche merchant.” These are people who are always on social media non stop and looking for weird and “niche” or “esoteric” and ironic jokes like “brainrot.” They want humor that makes them feel special or different. They usually end up referencing online jokes or ideas too much and their identity becomes tied to “I need to be different from everyone” which is an unhealthy way of thinking, as you’re trying too hard to be something that you don’t particularly enjoy.

Secondly, we have the “pseudo intellectual demon.” They would usually try to sound smart, but don’t actually study or research what they’ve said. A common symptom of this is people calling others a larp (live action roleplay), calling people grey (a robot), or new gen (someone who wasn’t there before something changed). These are slanders people use to make others think they’re dumber than they are. This is usually present in the youth music community, fashion, or even in a self-improvement community called “lookmaxing.” These communities create this word to feel more unique or “individualistic” than everyone else, even if it puts people down. This is unhealthy because they are trying to be something special, no matter if it stems from putting down others.

Lastly, we have the “group identity genie.” These types of internet individuals would chase popular or viral trends to feel included. They sometimes even gaslight themselves into thinking they are unique, even though what they are doing is what other people are doing. They build their whole personality around a fandom or niche interest they have just found. Sometimes, these individuals would exaggerate traits they have or even self-diagnose a mental condition to feel special or unique. These stem from gaslighting themselves into liking something that doesn’t reflect their true personal taste. Unhealthy individualism can mix with social pressure, performative identity, and obsession with appearing different to create these ideas.

The takeaway of these three is that extreme individualism can be a double-edged sword. Exploring is normal, but when it becomes a circus show or a performance influenced by a trend, it can distort and limit real self-expression.

What does it mean to be unique?

Being unique is to forget everything I try to influence. If you are being influenced by this article, it shows how subconsciously you’re trying to form an opinion that’s not yours, but an opinion your brain just keeps rehearsing.

History is the reason we’ve kept ourselves from passing the line we drew on various problems in life. History is the reason we are making decisions every day. We may not know what to do during the day, but we always put one foot in front of the other and try to make the best choices we can and go about our day alive. We make history every second, every minute, every hour, and every day. History has enabled us to do better. Before such things happened, it was common for people to be exploited, tortured, and even be in outright danger without any retributions placed on the perpetrators, or even any lessons learned by the people. However, these actions were taken to the extreme, leading to wars, foreign attacks, and even outright mass murder. This article will cover some of the biggest events in history that led to the creation of organizations, government agencies, & even groups (officially recognized or not).

Before the early 1910s, Women and Children, both boys and girls, were subjected to unsanitary, immeasurable, and often illegal (today) working conditions, from work hours that stretched beyond 24 hours, to physical harm being a possibility. This was mainly done during the Gilded Age, where companies exploited the common people. This was even continued into the Progressive Era of the early 20th century, where the population of the U.S. doubled, with those from eastern, central, and southern Europe entering the country. However, this did lead to the economy increasing by the turn of the 20th century, this also led to child labor, misogyny in the workplace, and more. On March 25th, 1911, a fire occurred at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in the Asch Building, now known as the Brown Building, in Lower Manhattan, specifically in Greenwich Village on the intersection of Greene Street and Washington Place. The fire started when someone dropped a cigarette butt in a trash bin filled with flammable materials. The bin was then knocked over by a worker walking by, leading the bin to set the floor on fire. The elevator was working, but it could only store up to a small fraction of the 146 employees, almost all of them being young immigrant women. The exits and doors were closed up, a practice at the time to ensure no unauthorized breaks were taken during shifts & to minimize potential theft, so the women and girls had to jump out the windows, falling to their deaths. The firehoses were also too short to reach the 8th, 9th, & 10th floors of the building. There were also no sprinklers in the building, so the fire spread everywhere. The fire led to safety standards being improved and helped the ILGWU (International Ladies’ Garment Worker’s Union) grow drastically.

After WW1, the Triple Entente placed an immeasurable amount of repapations on Germany, specifically 132,000,000,000 gold marks in reparations. It took over 90 years for Germany to pay it all off, the final amount was paid off in 2010. However, the Weimar Republic was already suffering from inflation and changing ideologies. Adolf Hitler, who was struggling at this point, decided that the German people needed to get back on their feet. So, he used Jews as a scapegoat for Germany losing WW1, since Germany had a sizable, distinct population of Jews in the early 20th century. He would later publish his manifesto, Mein Kampf, in 1925. All of this would lead to Ghettos, Blitzkrieg, and eventually WW2. Japan was just as monstrous as Nazi Germany, having used tactics to plow through their colonies to virtually out of existence. When Hitler committed suicide in April 1945, and the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were Nuked 4 and a half months later, both ended the war completely. In October of that same year, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was drafted and the United Nations was founded, with almost every country in the world coming together to ensure the bloodbath that was WW2 was never to happen again.

Air being used for transportation has only been a thing for 110+ years. And we still have a long way to go for it to reach the safety standards as water and land as transportation. While regulations for airplanes, like the various legislative acts enacted by Congress, we still have a long way to go to have aviation safety completely regulated. The terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001 opened a new chapter of new regulation and protocols. 9/11 exposed the flaws of airports and domestic security, as there were no scanners or x-ray machines before the traveler could enter into the terminal. This led to TSA (Transportation Security Administration) being founded 2 months after the attacks. 9/11 also exposed domestic security vulnerabilities, such as lack of communication between the FBI and CIA. The Department of Homeland security was also founded a year and a half after the attacks.

Not everything can be safe or secure the public.

How Does It Affect Us?,"More students are showing up at school more tired than ever before and research confirms this trend. National Health Surveys demonstrate that most teens are sleeping much less than the recommended eight to ten hours of sleep. Teachers can also see the changes in busy hallways and during early morning courses: droopy eyes, slow reactions, and the constant statements of “I’m so tired.” As the trend continues, researchers are starting to sound the cautionary note that being sleep-deprived is not only going to be uncomfortable but is also slowly depressing the overall academic performance of students.

Impact on Memory and Learning

Researchers studying sleep cycles in teenagers have found that during certain phases of sleep, particularly REM sleep, the brain mends and stores the things learned during the day. However, if sleep is shortened, there is less time for storage and the realization of insight. A student would be left wondering why they cannot recall important lessons when called on to for vocabulary, formulas from a lesson taught, or simply remembering what the teacher said. “Sleep is simply clicking save,” was what one cognitive science researcher offered during a study, stating, “when students lose sleep, they lose the ability to click save.”

Classroom Consequences

Teachers are observing effects in their classes as well. “You can tell right away when a class doesn’t sleep,” stated a teacher. “Their attention is gone. You ask them a question, and they just stare at you like they’re buffering.” Research backs up what she’s observing. Tired students have a harder time focusing, take longer to respond, and make more errors on tests and assignments. Even missing small amounts of sleep can add up to what researchers call a “sleep debt.” A long-term accumulation of tiredness makes learning even harder.

Student Perspectives

Students are feeling the pressure, too. “I try to study at night, but I just end up half asleep on my phone,” said one sophomore. “But I come to school, and it feels like my brain is buffering.” Most teens have homework (for some unreliable internet), sports, jobs, and blue light pulling them in all directions; it’s enough to create the perfect storm of chronic sleep deprivation.

Moving Toward Solutions

Experts believe that the solution doesn’t need to be complicated. Keep bedtimes the same, limit screen time before bed, and don’t over-schedule after-school activities. In fact, some schools around the country have tried starting school later, and early, evidence is beginning to show that attendance, grades, and possibly even academic performance seem to be improving. With the chatter about wellness in students becoming louder, sleep is increasingly hard to ignore. Research suggests that sleep isn’t a luxury, but instead is a learning tool. If students are interested in improving their focus, mood, and grades, a good night of sleep may be the most effective study strategy they haven’t yet experienced.",https://www.thenewdealer.org/opinion/2025/12/02/sleep-how-does-it-affect-us/,2025-12-02 00:00:00,"More students are showing up at school more tired than ever before and research confirms this trend.

https://www.thenewdealer.org/reviews/2025/10/08/nepals-social-media-elects-their-prime-minister-through-discord/,"Government Shutdown: Affects Many, How about FDR?","As many of us know, there was a full government shutdown that lasted over 43 days. As a result, over 1.3 Million Federal employees were left without pay, and expected to show up to work with no bonuses, nothing. SNAP benefits and social funds were also forced to be cut, affecting over 42 million Americans. Now this brings up the question, how did we get here and why? On October 1st, 2025, the United States Congress failed to pass a budget resolution by the September 30th deadline, as both parties failed to reach a compromise. This led to the federal government having insufficient funds to properly function, and therefore, led to the longest shutdown in American history. We have seen government shutdowns before, but they never lasted as long, nor impacted as many people as this one.



Now, this government shutdown greatly impacted federal employees, but what about teachers and students from FDR? Well, we’ll find out.



Two anonymous Teachers and Students from FDR were interviewed regarding the government shutdown with the same set of 5 questions. The interviews went as follows:



During the government shutdown, did you notice any differences in your daily life?



Teacher 1 – “No, I did not, however I do have a brother who is a federal judge, who wasn’t getting paid in spite of going to work everyday.”



Teacher 2 – “I would read things that were happening, but nothing happened to me directly.”



Student 1 – “Other than reading about it on the news, my life was not directly affected.”



Student 2 – “So I knew it was happening, but I didn’t notice any particular changes in my daily life. It could be just me not paying enough attention though.”

Did you have a personal story regarding the shutdown OR relatives who were directly affected?



Teacher 1 –”As I mentioned before, my brother is a federal judge who, unfortunately, isn’t getting paid as a result of the shutdown.”



Teacher 2 –”I know someone who had to take a longer way home because of the airport shutdown.”



Student 1 –”I haven’t heard of anyone I know who was directly affected, but there is likely survivor-ship bias to that, as the issue was less prevalent to the people I know in New York City.”



Student 2 –”As far as I’m aware nobody I know was personally affected.”



Are you relieved that the government shutdown is over?



Teacher 1 –”Yes, I am happy because I have family coming back from overseas and I want an airport with happy staff for them.”



Teacher 2 –”Yes, because it’s silly how our government is so caught up in partisanship, that they cannot do their jobs.”



Student 1 –”I’m unsure on how the bill passed affected my, or other people’s lives, so I am refraining from forming an opinion until later. However, I am relieved.”



Student 2 –”I’m glad to hear that the shutdown is over.”

Has the shutdown impacted your workplace OR student life in any way?



Teacher 1 –”No, not at all.”



Teacher 2 –”Not really, I thought there’d be more discussion about it, but it never happened.”



Student 1 –”Though my student life wasn’t affected, I am aware of other workplaces that were, such as executive branch officials being furloughed or working without pay.”



Student 2 –”Nothing in my school life seemed different.”

Do you have anything else you want to add before the interview concludes?



Teacher 1 –”I don’t like the rise in partisanship, where both parties are so set on winning that they don’t compromise.”



Teacher 2 –”I’m tired of these partisan political battles that are like a reality freak show.”



Student 1 –”While I personally don’t know anyone who was affected by the shutdown, I do know the experiences of many who were.”



Student 2 –”Nothing left to add on.”



In summary, the responses were largely similar, with the overall trend being that the government shutdown had little to no impact for some at FDR. Thankfully, the government shutdown is now over. Federal employees are being paid again, airport staff are happy, and social welfare programs are getting the much needed funds they deserve.

Teacher 1 –”Yes, I am happy because I have family coming back from overseas and I want an airport with happy staff for them.” Teacher 2 –”Yes, because it’s silly how our government is so caught up in partisanship, that they cannot do their jobs.” Student 1 –”I’m unsure on how the bill passed affected my, or other people’s lives, so I am refraining from forming an opinion until later. However, I am relieved.” Student 2 –”I’m glad to hear that the shutdown is over.” Has the shutdown impacted your workplace OR student life in any way? Teacher 1 –”No, not at all.” Teacher 2 –”Not really, I thought there’d be more discussion about it, but it never happened.” Student 1 –”Though my student life wasn’t affected, I am aware of other workplaces that were, such as executive branch officials being furloughed or working without pay.” Student 2 –”Nothing in my school life seemed different.” Do you have anything else you want to add before the interview concludes? Teacher 1 –”I don’t like the rise in partisanship, where both parties are so set on winning that they don’t compromise.” Teacher 2 –”I’m tired of these partisan political battles that are like a reality freak show.” Student 1 –”While I personally don’t know anyone who was affected by the shutdown, I do know the experiences of many who were.” Student 2 –”Nothing left to add on.” In summary, the responses were largely similar, with the overall trend being that the government shutdown had little to no impact for some at FDR. Thankfully, the government shutdown is now over. Federal employees are being paid again, airport staff are happy, and social welfare programs are getting the much needed funds they deserve. However, the stain of the shutdown still lingers in American politics.",0.0705263845350052,0.3993599791013584,neutral,"{'neg': 0.065, 'neu': 0.855, 'pos': 0.08, 'compound': 0.9429}",positive
https://www.thenewdealer.org/reviews/2025/10/08/nepals-social-media-elects-their-prime-minister-through-discord/,IV Pillar: Moliones – The New Dealer,"There was once a mortal named Moliones. He was nicknamed ‘Moliones the Unbidden Shield’, because he was known for guarding the realm of Theros for ninety-nine seasons. It wasn’t like he was asked or told to do this. The gods had left it behind for a reason. Theros was two things. One still lives. One, it was once the bridge between gods and mortals. Every single prayer that has ever been spoken was carried there first, following its separate path towards the home of each deity. But when the gods grew tired of mortal pleas, they severed the bridge. The gods called it noise, but Moliones called it hope. Two, Theros held magic that was unwritten. Magic that predated language that was wild, raw, and untamable. That was among the few things that the gods feared. This magic couldn’t be controlled or catalogued to the point where the gods simply abandoned it, with the hope or the idea that it would vanish, but instead, it waited. The magic of Theros did not ask for worship. It asked for will. This still lives. Magic cannot be erased—only ignored. And as long as one eye beholds it, it cannot fade. It resists oblivion. Ironically, during the ninety-ninth season, something dreadful happened. She came. Moliones was doing his non-asked duty until he heard a shattering like the sky had cracked open, echoing through the bones of the realm. He approached the event and watched the empty space, cracked, like an egg was trying to hatch open or someone was trying to come out of the mirror. He saw her gradually step out of the shattered space from the veil between realms, where reality thinned like glass, not with thunder nor with flame. But with the only sounds of something huge trying to break apart above him, echoing, but it was happening in front of him at a fair distance. She walked the broken bridge barefoot, her steps unmaking dust. Moliones stood from his ground, shield in hand, and knew her not by face, but by feeling. This was his first time seeing her. She was not a god. She was not mortal. She was what the gods feared more than magic itself: A will unbound by worship. They called her The Lady in Red.

Why? Because no one remembered her true name. This isn’t her actual form either. There was a famous saying that Moliones remembered so well. **

“She walked through the ruins with bare feet, and where she stepped, the earth forgot its name.”

He always thought she was a myth. Quite an underrated one, but still. He studied her as she approached him, slowly. Her skin looked like it was cracked like an ancient cracked vase, but veined with red light. She has no eyes. Her limbs were too long, her fingers tapered into threads that could simply slice through stone. She wore a gown made of stitched-together offerings from ruined or abandoned temples. And yet, her long dark hair flew behind her back from every step, from every speck of wind naturally passing by. But no matter what, Moliones stood his ground. Matter of fact, he decided to approach her. The Lady in Red halted. As for the man, he couldn’t tell if she was looking down at him or behind his shoulder. It was quiet for a moment until Moliones spoke up.

“What brings you here, ma’am?” he asked her. He spoke to her naturally. As if there was nothing off with her and she comes in daily.

“Do you not know who I am?” she said. Her voice was filled with multiple women’s voices that filled the realm.

Moliones held his shield firmly. “I’ve heard a bit about you. Is that enough?”

“No.”

“No?”

The Lady in Red narrowed her empty sockets. “You are a mortal, guarding what the gods have deemed worthless. And yet you stand, protecting what is left for the vultures.”

“It may be futile to the gods. But it is not to me,” he planted his shield into the ground. “And that is enough.”

The Lady in Red paused. The wind blew her gown slightly against the broken bridge. “You were not sent here,” she said. “You came here of your own accord.”

Moliones nodded once. “This realm mattered. So I came.”

She tilted her head again, slower this time. “You mortals are strange. You guard what no one asked you to protect. You stand where even gods turned away.”

“Then let them turn,” Moliones said. “I’m not here for them.”

A mortal going against someone who was obviously powerful than him told a lot to The Lady in Red. She usually viewed mortals as nothing since they are usually no threat. But this one caught her interest. For some reason, even though she could kill him right on this spot, she hesitated.

“You are not what I expected,” she said as her voice (still layered with echoes) seemed to slightly break character. “You carry the same defiance I once did. Before I became this.”

Moliones didn’t respond. He respected silently by listening.

“But I am not here to admire,” she continued. “I am here to consume.”

She raised one hand. Those threadlike fingers gloomed with ruin as the air around her began to fracture. The bridge groaned beneath her feet as her impact slowly conquered the realm.

“This realm is a wound. And I am the closing.”

Moliones knew his limitations. There was nothing he could do. He was overwhelmed. But the realm of Theros did not care. It did not seek strength; it sought witness. Moliones, who was now broken, was still watching everything unfold. However, this realm remembers everything. It remembered the prayers that once passed through. It remembered its purpose that it once served. It remembered Moliones. As the bridge cracked and the sky folded inward, Theros did what no other realm had done before. It fled. Not outward, but inward, into the only soul that had ever truly listened. It was so powerful that Moliones fell to his knees as the ground beneath him crumbled once, then vanished. The untamed magic rushed into him with no hesitation. What was left of the realm of Theros was now within him as a whole.

He didn’t rise immediately. He was listening carefully to the silence after Theros’ collapse. It wasn’t peace, but recalibration. The unwritten magic that was part of the realm had not yet settled in him. It felt like his body wasn’t his own anymore—more like part of someone’s story. He knew whatever had happened, it had changed him forever. He was more than just a man. He was a vessel. A witness. A keeper of a realm that had chosen him not for strength, but for resolute attention.

He knew his way out of the now destroyed realm. Once he stepped out of the portal that led to the once realm of Theros to the open vast world, he took in the beauty of it. After all, he was in that realm for ninety-nine seasons. There was something in him that told him that he wasn’t done yet. His other half seemed to yearn. And so, an unfamiliar will guided Moliones towards the sea. He did not know what he sought, but the answer for that lay behind the vast sea in front of him. Once he managed to get himself a small boat with the help of an old friend, he sailed off to the vast sea.

Many hours later, something was off, and Moliones could feel it. He halted the boat and listened. Only the sea responded. He tested the wind. Studied the waters. Everything seemed fine. So, why did his gut twist like a warning? He scanned the horizon. The water around the boat shifted unnaturally, not so violently nor loudly, but wrong. He took a closer look and realized, farther out, the sea began to circle itself. Slow, then faster. A whirlpool at its finest, forming like a mouth preparing to speak. Charybdis, the devourer of ships, the drowned daughter of Poseidon and Gaea, watched as Moliones didn’t flee, but stood there, glaring—not at her, the event. He couldn’t see Charybdis exactly, because what lurked beneath that massive vortex defied comprehension. A maw of ancient teeth like broken shipwrecks, arranged in concentric rings that stretched endlessly inward. Her mouth could dilate beyond physical limits, a cold void that remembered every human-made creation unmade. Despite who she was, Moliones approached her with his boat, but kept a good distance from the whirlpool that she had created. He stood firm as the sea moved around him strongly. Beneath the waves, Charybdis seemed to let curiosity take a role for that day. She had devoured many things before. Kings, fleets, anything that crosses the sea. But this mortal carried something unwritten.

“You are not whole,” she said, her voice was raspy, but layered like the waters rushing through. “Yet, you are not a man.”

Moliones nodded. “I guess you can say that I am part of a history of what remains. Crossing the sea for what I might seek.”

“Dominance?” she asked. “Or purpose?”

“Both,” he answered. “I will be my own force. Not someone’s steed.”

Charybdis stayed silent. This was her first time listening to someone’s story. She usually devoured her victims with no remorse. But this ‘half’ mortal seemed to catch her attention. First time feeling admiration for someone.

“Then you must pass through the Dual Sea,” she said. “There, you will find Kudos. He guards what you are not yet ready to touch.”

The whirlpool widened with its center darkening. From its heart, an aqua portal bloomed open as water folded inward, exposing a realm beneath realms. There was the Dual Sea.

“Go,” she whispered (or at least she tried to whisper), “Let me put this in your head: Kudos does not serve anyone.”

Moliones stepped forward as his boat creaked with the weight of fate. He crossed the threshold, the sea closing up behind him with silence.

After Moliones entered the portal, the Dual Sea wasn’t a place, but more of a sacred ground. What he saw in front of him was endless, layered water currents, moving in opposed directions. The surface silently glowed with the weight of submerged stars. He didn’t sail here; he drifted with no control. The realm itself carried him, despite apologizing for the rough ride there. Moliones held on tight as the force halted his boat. He took a breather and stepped out of the now ruined boat. He did not know someone was approaching him. A water serpentine dragon emerged slowly from the darkness with its dark navy coils slicing through the sea like ink through parchment. His shadowy horn glinted, solid and sharp. Golden eyes locked onto Moliones with a calculating gaze. Spikes lined his back, tail, and snout. His scales flowed like a living current with that majestic flow. When he felt the strong presence of the unwritten magic in him, his scales clicked outward, a sound like a thousand blades being readied. Moliones didn’t flinch. He held his shield and his sword firmly.

Kudos narrowed his gaze. “I don’t get visitors often,” he said, with his deep, but smooth voice. “Especially a visitor who carries something that does not belong to them.”

Moliones met his eyes. “It chose me. And I chose not to let it die.”

Kudos circled him once, very slowly and silently. “Then you are either a fool,” he said, “Or something new.”

“I came for dominance. To learn to get stronger than I was before, to never let something go ever again because of my limitations. I want to go beyond.”

Kudos’ scales clicked inward. “You entertain me. I guess I could consider it to be your mentor.”

Moliones didn’t speak. He simply bowed his head, not in submission, but in respect.

For a decade, Moliones trained beneath the currents of the Dual Sea. Kudos taught him the dragon ways: how to wield breath without flame, how to speak in silence, and how to bend water without breaking it. They sparred, studied, and endured. Somewhere between the trials and the tides, they fell in love. It was not planned in any way. From that bond, the unwritten magic stirred. One night, as Moliones meditated beneath the stars submerged in the sea’s surface, he felt a pressure in his chest. He opened his mouth, and from within, two small forms emerged. Scaled, clawed, and golden-eyed. The two twins. Rassu and his sister, Vasso.

Well magic did not just put them there! Two of our Cougar family members played a big role on making it happen, Ms. Williams, our AP of Science, and Gina Intindola, one of Ms. Repole’s secretaries. The New Dealer was very lucky to get the opportunity to speak to each of them about these incredible murals.

Ms. Williams Interview:

How do you feel hallway murals benefit the FDR community?

Hallway murals help the school environment by promoting a sense of pride and belonging. It also shares themes of identity commonly held by both students and staff. They visually celebrate our diverse community, highlight academic disciplines or subject areas, and remind that FDR High School is a place where content, culture, and creativity are honored.

Our murals also increase student engagement by making our hallways more welcoming, inspiring curiosity, and encouraging students to take ownership of their school space. In addition, they promote school spirit and help communicate our values diversity, equity, empowerment and persistence to everyone who enters our doors.

How were students involved in the mural process for the Science Department?

Students played an active role in shaping the Science Department murals. We invited student submissions through their art classes. Three designs were submitted, and one design was selected for our mural on the 4th floor. Participating students were Alexa Tlatelpa (Design, Class or 2024), Yukiko Izumi (Contributing Artist), and Kristy McCarthy (Art Direction). In addition, Daniel Britton-George (Design, Class of 2025), Yukiko Izumi (Contributing Artist), and Kristy McCarthy (Art Direction) created the 3rd-floor mural after Daniel was inspired while listening to science teachers discuss various happenings and themes from his science classes. His design reflects the ideas and content he heard shared in the science office.

First, what is this new ban? The new cellphone ban policy is a “bell to bell” cell phone ban in schools K-12 for the 2025 to 2026 school year, which prohibits students from using cellphones and any internet-enabled devices not provided by the school. This was created to create a more social and engaged environment for students. Most schools have students placing their phones in a pouch everyday before school, and are prohibited from taking it out during school hours. Kathy Hochul, the governor of NY, signed the “Distraction-Free Schools” law which requires restrictions on cell phone usage during school hours.

The cellphone ban in NY started on the 25-26 school year, and has been going on for around 3 months. With this new ban, schools may or may not have changed. Schools may have also changed for the worst, or the best. In one high school called FDR (Franklin Delano Roosevelt), teachers and students have given their responses to this change.

Two teachers and two students were interviewed. These were the questions and responses.

How do you feel the cell phone ban has impacted classroom dynamics and student engagement?

Teacher responses:

Having no cellphones made the classroom more engaging.

Students not having cellphones are great because students participate more.

Student responses:

No change in classroom dynamics and engagement.

There has been an increase in social activities by students today.

Have you noticed any changes in student behavior or attitudes?

Teacher responses:

Students talk to each other more, and are more behaved.

Some students become more engaged and more behaved, while others stay childish.

Student responses:

Students talk to their friends more, and they are more social.

Yes, students become more socially engaged with each other.

What are your thoughts on the possibility of emergencies, and the possibility students can not reach out to parents?

Teacher responses:

If there are any emergency situations, the school will notify your parents.

In an emergency, administrators would be able to unlock the Yonder pouches quickly.

Student responses:

A serious and negative outcome to the ban

A big issue if there actually was an emergency.

Has the ban impacted your workplace in any way?

Teacher responses:

Forces kids to learn without the use of technology, which can have a positive impact.

Students normally take surveys on their phones, but because of the ban, they can no longer do so.

Student responses:

The ban has affected students’ daily lives, as they can no longer search for information on Google.

Students will no longer be able to access google translate for translations when needed.

Do you feel like social interactions have changed?

Teachers response:

Student interactions have not changed entirely, since students have always been interacting with each other.

Yes, I have noticed more interactions with peers and students have had more confidence.

Student response:

Yes, there have been more social interactions between students.

There have been more social activities in schools.

In summary, this cell phone ban policy has created more social interactions, and a more talkative environment for students. This not only improved student engagement, but also student behavior. Although there are some cons like emergencies, and google translate, there are more pros than cons meaning that this new cell phone ban has been a success so far. While teachers may like this ban, most students argue that this is absurd. Although it seems to be working, the school year has not ended yet, meaning that this outcome could potentially change in the future.",https://www.thenewdealer.org/student-life/2025/12/02/inside-nycs-new-cell-phone-ban-how-fdr-teachers-and-students-are-responding/,2025-12-02 00:00:00,"The Cellphone ban policy in NY has been a controversy and heated change in schools recently.

Critics say it's for 'wrong reasons'.,"Less than two months into his five-year tenure, Dharan Sub Metropolitan City’s Mayor Harka Raj Rai, popularly known as Harka Sampang Rai, seems very busy, cleaning streets, taking measures to confine monkeys to forests, and joining hands with city-dwellers to lay drinking water pipes.

In a city affected by rampant drug abuse problem among youth, Rai is also spearheading an awareness-raising initiative aimed at keeping local youth away from substances. As if that was not enough, Rai has been urging road-users to strictly follow traffic rules.

Leading a series of reform measures in the city - nestled in the shadows of green hills in eastern Nepal’s Province-1 - Rai stunned many people recently when he proposed to forgo his luxury car facility altogether, sell his office Scorpio worth Rs 5.1 million and instead buy a roller machine to fix Dharan’s dilapidated core city streets.

Motorcycle-riding mayor

With such noble steps, the motorcycle-driving mayor is winning accolades from many voters within his constituency and from across the country.

This past weekend, the 39-year-old was seen working together with a group of city-dwellers at a reservoir site at Pakuwa River. There, work is in progress to divert water to Dharan 11 and 17, where residents have been facing water shortages for years.

Dharan, home to over 1.7 million people, has been facing a drinking water crisis for years, and the new mayor has promised to do everything he can to make sure that Dharan-dwellers have enough water to drink. Besides water sources like the Pakuwa river and Khardu Khola, Rai has pledged to look into the possibility of diverting water from the mighty Koshi river that flows down into India from the western part of Dharan.

A fiercely independent candidate with no political affiliation or background, Rai’s father was a British Gurkha soldier. Before becoming a social reform campaigner – with his Facebook page ‘Harka Sampang A Revolution’ – Rai worked as an English teacher while his wife runs a small neighbourhood grocery.

But his victory as mayor of Dharan following May local elections – with stick as an election symbol just like another independent candidate Balen Shah’s in Kathmandu - changed all that. He contested the election promising to ensure good governance, build basic infrastructure such as roads, drinking water facilities, schools and hospitals.

Reactions

After some work at the Pakuwa water intake site last Saturday, Rai wrote on his Facebook page: “After Pakuwa, now we will build three water intakes at Khardu.”

Reacting to that, one Rakesh Lamichhane wrote below his post: “If you can ensure smooth water supply in Dharan in five years’ time that will be a huge feat and people will always remember you.” Himal Limbu wrote: “Long ago, when Man Mohan Adhikari was the prime minister, we heard about ‘let’s build our own villages’. Now you are actually doing it.”

But Harka Raj Rai has some critics too, who claim, the Dharan mayor is currently busy stealing the limelight by making populist moves, one after another. Overall, Dharan-watchers say, it’s too early to judge as he was another five years to prove his mettle and his worth as a mayor.

The new PM was born in a family with close contacts with the Koirala political dynasty, from the country's largest democratic party Nepali Congress, and later married the then-leader Durga Subedi.

Journalists played a lead role in resisting and ultimately reversing an audacious 14-month power grab by King Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev. Hundreds took to the streets in the capital, Kathmandu, and elsewhere to protest measures by the king to suspend radio news broadcasts and deploy the country’s security forces and civil authorities to harass and censor the press. Journalists’ refusal to bend to these restrictions contributed to a popular shift in favor of democracy. In April, political party leaders, civil-society activists, and journalists joined in mass demonstrations held in defiance of the government’s shoot-on-sight curfew orders. Nineteen people were killed in a crackdown on the protests, but the violent response backfired on the king. By April 24, his support eroding, Gyanendra pledged to return power to Parliament.

The king’s ostensible reason for seizing direct control of the country in February 2005 was to force an end to the 10-year conflict between the government and Maoist rebels fighting to overthrow Nepal’s constitutional monarchy. In the end, it was Gyanendra’s downfall that brought this goal within tenuous reach. After wresting control of the Royal Nepalese Army from the king, the Seven Party Alliance headed by newly appointed Prime Minister G.P. Koirala entered into peace talks with Maoists under rebel leader Prachanda. The two sides bridged differences over rebel disarmament and the future of the monarchy to forge a peace deal in November declaring a formal end to the war. The accord cleared the way for the 2007 election of a constituent assembly expected to decide the ultimate fate of the monarchy and rewrite the country’s constitution.

Serious problems remained. The country had been torn apart by conflict, and reports of extortion, abduction, and the recruitment of children to the Maoists’ People’s Liberation Army marred hopes for an immediate recovery. Journalists, who had long been targeted by both the government and the rebels, received assurances from Koirala and Prachanda that press freedom would be respected; improvements in media conditions after the king relinquished control were indisputable. Outside of Kathmandu, though, members of the press faced continued threats and harassment by local government officials, criminal groups, and, particularly, Maoist cadres.

Hundreds of journalists were detained throughout 2005 and in early 2006 for participating in or covering protests, but most were held only briefly. A greater threat was neutralized in July, when the interim government announced that no new cases would be filed under the repressive Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Ordinance (TADO), and that all prisoners held under TADO would be freed. The ordinance had been used to imprison accused Maoists, including journalists allegedly sympathetic to their cause, for long periods without charge or trial. Among those released in July was former Yojana newspaper editor Tej Narayan Sapkota, who was held in a series of army barracks and detention centers after his arrest at a printing facility in 2003. No journalist remained behind bars in Nepal when CPJ conducted its annual census of imprisoned journalists on December 1.

The war left a record of routine abuse and torture by security personnel, who were largely given free rein under legislation like TADO. Journalist and lawyer Jitman Basnet, who was imprisoned under the antiterrorism ordinance in 2004 under suspicion of supporting the Maoists, filed a petition before the Supreme Court in October calling for action against security forces involved in torturing detainees. Basnet said that while detained, he had been held under water, underfed, and forced to urinate on an electric heater.

The Seven Party Alliance government scrapped antimedia ordinances and policies promulgated after the king’s coup, including a practice of purchasing advertising from loyal news outlets only. The alliance also solicited advice on promoting press freedom from a 13-member media commission composed of prominent independent journalists and media executives. The commission presented its report in September with recommendations on simplifying the procedures for obtaining a license to run an FM radio station, detaching public media from government control, and allowing greater foreign investment in the media.

The panel also recommended that drafts for a new constitution should note the role of the press in restoring democracy in the country and ensure press freedom and the right of information. Media advocates pointed out that an interim draft constitution proposed in November differed only slightly from the country’s 1990 constitution in regard to press freedom–and included restrictions on the rights to seek information and report matters of public interest. Political leaders pledged the need for wider media protections in the drafting of a permanent constitution, which is expected after the 2007 constituent assembly elections.

Private FM radio news, a primary source of information for the large, illiterate population in Nepal and a particular target of Gyanendra, continued a recovery that began in 2005 with legal challenges to the king’s ban on private radio news programming. As many as 2,000 radio journalists who had lost their jobs went back to work broadcasting news. Requirements for registering radio stations were eased, raising hopes for a revival exceeding pre-2005 conditions.

Despite these improvements, journalists continued to face threats and harassment in outlying rural areas. Intimidation by Maoist cadres posed a threat to independent reporting on obstacles to the peace process in regions under Maoist control. In October, the Federation of Nepalese Journalists (FNJ) released a report detailing attacks on journalists after the democratic uprising, including an attempt by Maoists in Nawalparasi to force two print correspondents to become members of their party; an incident in which a group of people padlocked the offices of a newspaper in the district of Morang after it reported an alleged sexual assault of a minor by a Maoist; and the three-hour detention of journalists who had traveled to the district of Bara to report on the construction of a dam. On October 16, a local Maoist leader in the eastern district of Udaypur warned journalists that only Maoists could write about Maoists.",https://cpj.org/2007/02/attacks-on-the-press-2006-nepal-1/,2007-02-05 16:21:10+00:00,"NEPAL Journalists played a lead role in resisting and ultimately reversing an audacious 14-month power grab by King Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev.

On October 16, a local Maoist leader in the eastern district of Udaypur warned journalists that only Maoists could write about Maoists.",0.0638789973467392,0.4089757017176371,neutral,"{'neg': 0.161, 'neu': 0.716, 'pos': 0.123, 'compound': -0.9942}",negative

Production [ edit ]

Release [ edit ]

In October 2024, it was announced that the anime series would go on hiatus until April 2025, and that a remastered and re-edited version of the ""Fishman Island"" story arc would air in the show's timeslot during the break.[7] After returning, the show would move to Sunday nights for the first time since 2006, marking the anime's return to a primetime network timeslot.[8] episode 1123 premiered on April 5, 2025, as part of the network's Premium Saturday (ja) timeslot before moving to its fixed Sunday night slot a day later, beginning with episode 1124 on April 6.[9]

On October 28, 2025, it was announced that the series would go on hiatus from January to March 2026. It set to return in April 2026 and adopt a divided, two-cours-per-year structure, with a maximum of 26 episodes annually. This marks a shift from the continuous year-round structure that has been in place since the series' premiere in 1999.[10]

English localization and broadcasting [ edit ]

On June 8, 2004, 4Kids Entertainment acquired the license for distribution of One Piece in North America;[11] 4Kids Entertainment contracted Viz Media to handle home video distribution. 4Kids' in-house musicians wrote a new background score and theme song nicknamed ""Pirate Rap"". 4Kids' dub mandated edits for content and length, which reduced the first 143 episodes into 104.[12] Initially, 4Kids originally created an English version of the first opening theme, ""We Are!"" by Russell Velazquez.[13] It premiered in the United States on September 18, 2004 on the Fox network as part of the weekend programming block FoxBox TV, and later aired on Cartoon Network on their Saturday night action programming block, Toonami in April 2005. It also aired in other blocks and line-ups, such as its Monday-Thursday night prime-time line-up and its Miguzi weekday after-school action block in 2006. Production was halted in 2006 after episode 143/104;[14][15] Viz also ceased its home video release of the series after volume 11. On July 22, 2010, an interview with Anime News Network and Mark Kirk, senior vice-president of digital media for 4Kids Entertainment, revealed that 4Kids acquired One Piece as part of a package deal with other anime, and that the company did not screen the series before licensing it. However, once 4Kids realized One Piece was not appropriate for their intended demographic, the company decided to edit it into a more child-oriented series until they had an opportunity to legally drop the license. Kirk said the experience of producing One Piece ""ruined the company's reputation"". Since then, 4Kids established a stricter set of guidelines, checks, and balances to determine which anime the company acquires.[16]

On April 13, 2007, Funimation (later Crunchyroll, LLC) licensed the series and started production on an English-language release of One Piece[17] which also included re-dubbing the episodes previously dubbed by 4Kids. In an interview with voice actor Christopher Sabat, he stated that Funimation had been interested in acquiring One Piece from the very beginning, and produced a ""test episode,"" in which Sabat portrayed the character of Helmeppo and Eric Vale played the part of the main character, Monkey D. Luffy. (They would later go on to provide the English voices for Roronoa Zoro and Sanji, respectively.)[18] After resuming production of the renewed English dub, which featured less censorship because of fewer restrictions on cable programming, Funimation released its first uncut, bilingual DVD box set containing 13 episodes on May 27, 2008,[19] similarly sized sets followed with fourteen sets released.[20] The Funimation dubbed episodes premiered on Cartoon Network on September 29, 2007 and aired until its removal on March 22, 2008.[21] On October 28, 2011, Funimation posted a press release on their official website confirming the acquisition of episodes 206–263, and the aspect ratio, beginning with episode 207, would be changed to the 16:9 widescreen format.[22] On May 18, 2013, the uncut series began airing on Adult Swim's revived Toonami late-night programming block skipping ahead to episode 207 onward.[23][24] One Piece was removed from the Toonami block after March 18, 2017.[25] The series returned to Toonami, skipping ahead to episode 517, on January 22, 2022.[26]

In May 2009, Funimation, Toei Animation, Shueisha, and Fuji TV announced they would simulcast stream the series within an hour of the weekly Japanese broadcast at no charge.[27] Originally scheduled to begin on May 30, 2009, with episode 403, a lack of security resulted in a leak of the episode, and Funimation delayed the offer until episode 415 on August 29, 2009.[28][29][30]

On February 12, 2013, it was announced that Manga Entertainment would start releasing the Funimation dub of One Piece in the United Kingdom in a DVD box set format.[31] Crunchyroll began simulcasting the series on November 2, 2013, for the United States, Canada, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Latin America.[32] Crunchyroll later expanded access to the United Kingdom and Ireland, as well as a majority of European territories, on February 22, 2020.[33] In April 2020, Netflix officially announced that they would be streaming One Piece starting on June 12 of the same year, for the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, using the ""Special Edition"" print.[34] Netflix announced that they would stream the Egghead story arc starting on January 13, 2024.[35]

Films [ edit ]

A total of 15 animated theatrical films based on the One Piece series have been released in Japan. The films are typically released in March in accordance with the spring vacation of Japanese schools.[36] The films feature self-contained, completely original plots, or retellings of story arcs with animation of a higher quality than what the weekly anime allows. The first three films were typically double features paired up with other anime films, and were thus usually an hour or less in length. Funimation has licensed the eighth, tenth, twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth films for release in North America, and these films have received in-house dubs by the company.[37]

Television specials [ edit ]

The One Piece franchise has spawned 13 television specials that aired on Fuji TV. Of these specials, the first four, as well as the sixth, eighth, ninth, and eleventh are original stories created by the anime staff with the exception of the fifth, seventh, tenth, twelfth, and thirteenth specials, which are alternate re-tellings of certain story arcs.

Critical reception [ edit ]

In a review of the second DVD release of 4Kids Entertainment's dub, Todd Douglass, Jr. of DVD Talk called its adaptation a ""shabby treatment"" resulting in an ""arguably less enjoyable rendition"". Douglass said that the 4Kids original opening was ""a crappy rap song"" and that the removal of whole scenes leaves a ""feeling that something is missing"". He later went on to say that ""Fans of the 'real' One Piece will want to skip picking [...] up [4Kids Entertainment's One Piece DVDs] until an uncut release is announced"", and also stated that ""kids may get into this version because it's what they have seen on TV"".[56] Margaret Veira of activeAnime praised the TV series' ""great"" animation, stating that ""It gives life and stays true to the style and characters of the manga."" She notes the fight scenes in particular have ""a lot of energy to them"".[57] Patrick King of Animefringe comments that the art style of One Piece is ""very distinctive and fresh"".[58]

In a review of the first Funimation DVD release for Mania Entertainment, Bryce Coulter comments that One Piece is ""not your typical pirate adventure"" and that mixed with ""the right amount of random fun along with a shonen style storyline"" it becomes ""an appealing and fun romp"".[59] In a review of Funimation's second DVD release for Mania Entertainment, Bryce Coulter comments that ""You can tell that they are giving One Piece the attention that was neglected by 4Kids"" and that ""One Piece is a great tale of high-seas fun that will leave you wanting more!""[60]

In Indonesia, Global TV was reprimanded by the Indonesian Broadcasting Commission (KPI) for airing the anime television series. Nina Armando, member of the KPI and a lecturer at the University of Indonesia, said the show should not be aired at times when children are likely to watch.[61]

On July 22, 2010, an interview with Anime News Network and Mark Kirk, senior vice-president of digital media for 4Kids Entertainment, revealed that 4Kids acquired One Piece as part of a package deal with other anime, and that the company did not screen the series before licensing it. However, once 4Kids realized One Piece was not appropriate for their intended demographic, the company decided to edit it into a more child-oriented series until they had an opportunity to legally drop the license. Kirk said the experience of producing One Piece ""ruined the company's reputation"". Since then, 4Kids established a stricter set of guidelines, checks, and balances to determine which anime the company acquires.[16] On April 13, 2007, Funimation (later Crunchyroll, LLC) licensed the series and started production on an English-language release of One Piece[17] which also included re-dubbing the episodes previously dubbed by 4Kids. In an interview with voice actor Christopher Sabat, he stated that Funimation had been interested in acquiring One Piece from the very beginning, and produced a ""test episode,"" in which Sabat portrayed the character of Helmeppo and Eric Vale played the part of the main character, Monkey D. Luffy. (They would later go on to provide the English voices for Roronoa Zoro and Sanji, respectively.)[18] After resuming production of the renewed English dub, which featured less censorship because of fewer restrictions on cable programming, Funimation released its first uncut, bilingual DVD box set containing 13 episodes on May 27, 2008,[19] similarly sized sets followed with fourteen sets released.[20] The Funimation dubbed episodes premiered on Cartoon Network on September 29, 2007 and aired until its removal on March 22, 2008.[21] On October 28, 2011, Funimation posted a press release on their official website confirming the acquisition of episodes 206–263, and the aspect ratio, beginning with episode 207, would be changed to the 16:9 widescreen format.[22] On May 18, 2013, the uncut series began airing on Adult Swim's revived Toonami late-night programming block skipping ahead to episode 207 onward.[23][24] One Piece was removed from the Toonami block after March 18, 2017.[25] The series returned to Toonami, skipping ahead to episode 517, on January 22, 2022.[26] In May 2009, Funimation, Toei Animation, Shueisha, and Fuji TV announced they would simulcast stream the series within an hour of the weekly Japanese broadcast at no charge.[27] Originally scheduled to begin on May 30, 2009, with episode 403, a lack of security resulted in a leak of the episode, and Funimation delayed the offer until episode 415 on August 29, 2009.[28][29][30] On February 12, 2013, it was announced that Manga Entertainment would start releasing the Funimation dub of One Piece in the United Kingdom in a DVD box set format.[31] Crunchyroll began simulcasting the series on November 2, 2013, for the United States, Canada, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Latin America.[32] Crunchyroll later expanded access to the United Kingdom and Ireland, as well as a majority of European territories, on February 22, 2020.[33] In April 2020, Netflix officially announced that they would be streaming One Piece starting on June 12 of the same year, for the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, using the ""Special Edition"" print.[34] Netflix announced that they would stream the Egghead story arc starting on January 13, 2024.[35] Films [ edit ] A total of 15 animated theatrical films based on the One Piece series have been released in Japan. The films are typically released in March in accordance with the spring vacation of Japanese schools.[36] The films feature self-contained, completely original plots, or retellings of story arcs with animation of a higher quality than what the weekly anime allows. The first three films were typically double features paired up with other anime films, and were thus usually an hour or less in length. Funimation has licensed the eighth, tenth, twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth films for release in North America, and these films have received in-house dubs by the company.[37] Television specials [ edit ] The One Piece franchise has spawned 13 television specials that aired on Fuji TV. Of these specials, the first four, as well as the sixth, eighth, ninth, and eleventh are original stories created by the anime staff with the exception of the fifth, seventh, tenth, twelfth, and thirteenth specials, which are alternate re-tellings of certain story arcs.

The first episode of the anime adaptation earned a viewer rating of 12.4%, behind Pokémon and ahead of Ojamajo Doremi.[47] In Japan, One Piece has consistently been among the top five animated shows in television viewer ratings, as of 2020 .[48][49][50] On international online video platforms, the One Piece anime got 1.9 million demand expressions per month in 2016, making it the year's most popular anime and fourteenth most popular TV show in the world, according to Business Insider.[51][52] In the United States, where it is available on the Hulu streaming platform, One Piece was 2018's most binge-watched television show in the states of Illinois and Wisconsin.[53] In 2022, One Piece was the most watched TV show of the year in the world, beating Stranger Things,[54] and Monkey D. Luffy was ranked as top three world's most popular character according to TV Time, a popular tracking service.[55] Critical reception [ edit ] In a review of the second DVD release of 4Kids Entertainment's dub, Todd Douglass, Jr. of DVD Talk called its adaptation a ""shabby treatment"" resulting in an ""arguably less enjoyable rendition"". Douglass said that the 4Kids original opening was ""a crappy rap song"" and that the removal of whole scenes leaves a ""feeling that something is missing"". He later went on to say that ""Fans of the 'real' One Piece will want to skip picking [...] up [4Kids Entertainment's One Piece DVDs] until an uncut release is announced"", and also stated that ""kids may get into this version because it's what they have seen on TV"".[56] Margaret Veira of activeAnime praised the TV series' ""great"" animation, stating that ""It gives life and stays true to the style and characters of the manga."" She notes the fight scenes in particular have ""a lot of energy to them"".[57] Patrick King of Animefringe comments that the art style of One Piece is ""very distinctive and fresh"".[58] In a review of the first Funimation DVD release for Mania Entertainment, Bryce Coulter comments that One Piece is ""not your typical pirate adventure"" and that mixed with ""the right amount of random fun along with a shonen style storyline"" it becomes ""an appealing and fun romp"".[59] In a review of Funimation's second DVD release for Mania Entertainment, Bryce Coulter comments that ""You can tell that they are giving One Piece the attention that was neglected by 4Kids"" and that ""One Piece is a great tale of high-seas fun that will leave you wanting more!""[60] In Indonesia, Global TV was reprimanded by the Indonesian Broadcasting Commission (KPI) for airing the anime television series. Nina Armando, member of the KPI and a lecturer at the University of Indonesia, said the show should not be aired at times when children are likely to watch.[61] Awards and accolades [ edit ] The first opening of the One Piece anime television series, ""We Are!"", won the Animation Kobe Theme Song Award of the year 2000.[62] In February 2001, One Piece placed ninth among anime television series in Japan.[63] In 2001, the readers of Animage, a popular Japanese anime magazine, voted the anime television series in fifth place of The Readers' Picks for the Anime that should be remembered in the 21st century.[64] In June 2002, Animage readers voted One Piece to be the sixteenth best new anime of 2001[65] and voted it sixteenth place in 2004 in the category Favorite Anime Series.[66] In a 2005 web poll by Japanese television network TV Asahi, One Piece was voted sixth most popular animated TV series.[67] Before the poll, TV Asahi broadcast another list based on a nationwide survey in which One Piece placed fourth among teenagers.[68] In 2006, the series was elected 32nd of the Top 100 Japanese anime by TV Asahi and 21st by its viewers.[69][70] Funimation's first DVD release of the series ""One Piece: Season 1 First Voyage"" was nominated for the Fifth Annual TV DVD Awards.[71] One Piece was nominated for Best Continuing Series at the 3rd Crunchyroll Anime Awards in 2019;[72] it went on to win in the same category at the seventh edition in 2023;[73] and in eighth edition in 2024, with Monkey D.

Dil Bhushan Pathak reported three weeks ago about the alleged investments of a member of a political family. Kathmandu’s district court issued an arrest warrant for him on June 11 following a complaint by the family to the Cyber Bureau of Nepal Police.

On June 16, the Patan high court issued a temporary order that Pathak should not be arrested, but on June 17 police issued a fresh summons to Pathak in apparent disregard of the court order. At the time of writing this dispatch, police had not been able to locate Pathak.

Pathak is being sought under Nepal’s Electronic Transactions Act, a law which is purportedly designed to regulate online transactions, but which has previously been used to arrest people in relation to online speech. On the same day that the district court issued the arrest warrant it also used the same law to order two news sites to remove stories referring to the Securities and Exchange Board of Nepal.

Last week, a government minister reportedly telephoned the director of a separate media company and threatened that to “take action to bring [the company] down” if it did not remove reporting of Pathak’s case from its website. The minister has denied the allegation

While Nepali authorities have sometimes sought to silence traditional newspapers and broadcasters, most recent cases relate to social media and online news portals. Last year, police used cybercrimes charges to arrest at least two people who had posted photos or videos critical of political leaders. “Whenever someone raises questions about a public figure in Nepal, there is a tendency to file a cybercrime case without any investigation,” former Supreme Court Justice Balram KC told the Nepali Times.

Earlier this year, Nepal’s parliament adopted a controversial new Media Council Act, which empowers the government to appoint the head of a new media regulator. Press freedom advocates have also expressed concern at a proposed new law that would create vague, new criminal offences related to social media, punishable with jail terms of up to five years and fines up to NRs1.5 million (US$10,800).

https://niemanreports.org/nepal-gen-z-protests-memes-discord-revolution-oli-one-piece/,"Nepal: Restrictive social media legislation, targeting of journalists and excessive force at protests put freedoms at risk","The state of civic space in Nepal is rated as ‘obstructed’ by the CIVICUS Monitor. Documented violations of fundamental freedoms include arbitrary arrests and the use of excessive force with impunity during protests, as well as the ongoing targeting of journalists, including through harassment, attacks and criminalisation.

Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in January 2025 that the lack of justice for conflict-era crimes has contributed to a widespread crisis of impunity in Nepal, undermining human rights, governance, and the rule of law. In March 2025, the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) reported that Nepal’s leading political authorities, including the Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, together with civil society groups, have pledged to redouble their efforts to improve and implement effective transitional justice mechanisms and procedures to ensure accountability and reparations.

In April 2025, Amnesty International said that the government suppressed criticism in 2024 by enforcing restrictions on protests, using unlawful force, and forcibly dispersing and detaining demonstrators. Further, journalists, activists and online critics faced intensified restrictions on freedom of expression.

In recent months, the government attempted to pass a restrictive social media bill, while unregistered social media platforms face a ban under a 2023 directive. There are concerns around the passage of the Media Council Bill that could be used to curtail journalists and influence independent media. Journalists and media outlets continue to be targeted with impunity while police arrested or used excessive force against protesters. In at least one case deadly force was used.

Expression

Social media bill raises free speech concerns

In February 2025, concerns were raised about a new bill aimed at regulating social media that had the potential to impact on freedom of speech. Critics argued that its vague provisions could suppress political dissent and contradict constitutionally protected rights.

On 9th February 2025, the 'Bill on the Operation, Use, and Regulation of Social Media', referred to as the Social Media Act Bill, was introduced in Nepal’s National Assembly, designed to regulate social media platforms and users through increased registration, penalisation, and content moderation.

The bill would require social media platforms to register with the government to operate in Nepal, enforce strict content moderation policies, and target harmful activities online, including extortion, cyberbullying, phishing, scams, and hacking, specifically defining and determining digital crimes.

Concerningly, the bill would also grant authorities the ability to remove ‘indecent’ or ‘misleading’ content, further criminalise remarks deemed defamatory, criminalise the sharing of ‘trolling’ images, and penalise those spreading images or audiovisuals which could harm someone’s reputation, among others. The bill would also criminalise interacting with social media with ‘malicious intent’ and prohibit the disclosure of ‘confidential information’. Many sections within the bill have been identified as problematic for being overly vague and criticised for their potential for abuse from authorities. The bill could impose fines of up to 2.5 million Nepali rupees (USD 18,300), and up to five years’ imprisonment, with punishments able to accumulate for concurrent charges.

Santosh Sigdel, executive director of the non-profit Digital Rights Nepal said the bill would impose “an impractical onus on users.” It also bars the creation or use of anonymous profiles, which could restrict investigative journalists in particular. Sigdel was also concerned that the proposed law could allow a government department to undertake surveillance of journalists through its monitoring of social media content. The unnamed department “responsible for information technology” could also order social media platforms to remove content.

The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) said: “In its current form, the Social Media Bill threatens to severely undermine press freedom and digital expression. This bill must be withdrawn or subject to significant amendments limiting its potential to be weaponised against the media.”

At the time of writing the Social Media bill is still in the National Assembly and has yet to be passed.

Unregistered social media platforms face ban

On 9th May 2025, Digital Rights Nepal reported that The Ministry of Communication and Information Technology has once again issued a warning to social media platforms to register in Nepal under the Directives for Managing the Use of Social Networks, 2023. Despite a passed deadline, only TikTok, Viber and Weetok have complied.

Major platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and X are yet to register, appoint local liaison officers, or implement complaint and content moderation systems. Minister Prithvi Subba Gurung clarified that the goal is not to enforce an immediate ban but to ensure accountability and a safer digital space. The government is currently conducting an impact assessment to evaluate potential consequences of non-compliance.

In early May 2025, Digital Rights Nepal convened a coalition of 31 civil society organisations, digital rights advocates, and media groups. They issued a joint public statement, making a number of recommendations including to ensure that any regulation of digital platforms is transparent, inclusive, and rooted in democratic principles and to initiate meaningful dialogue with civil society, platform representatives, and technical experts before taking enforcement actions.

Concerns around the passage of the Media Council Bill

Concerns have been raised around a Media Council Bill that was passed in February 2025.

The new Media Council Bill replaces the existing Press Council responsible for upholding the standards of free press with the Media Council, a new regulatory body to monitor conduct, advise on policy, and ensure compliance with ethics in Nepal’s media. This could threaten journalistic freedom as a provision in the bill for a government appointed chairperson to lead the council has exacerbated concerns about government influence over independent media.

Additionally, the Media Council Bill aims to make “digital, online and print journalism more decent, accountable and credible”, sparking worries that independent media could be curtailed and journalists put at risk of being targeted through vague and subjective terms.

While the bill removed many of the more contentious provisions proposed in an earlier draft, such as fines and prison sentences for publishing content deemed offensive, Suresh Acharya, former president of the Federation of Nepali Journalists, criticised the bill for not addressing their concerns regarding the government's oversight of the council.

Media groups called on the government to amend the Media Council Bill to ensure it has a balanced structure by including a Chairperson with a judicial background, experts and representatives from the media sector, and representatives from media consumers as members.

Targeting of journalists and media outlets

There continues to be concerns about the harassment and attacks on journalists, often with impunity.

Kamal Bahadur Bohara, editor of Palikasamaya.com, a local government-focused online news portal, revealed that he was physically assaulted over a published news story. On 1st February 2025 journalist Bohara published a news story criticising Kathmandu Metropolitan City Mayor Balendra Shah. After the report, he received phone calls from people associated with the mayor. On 3rd February 2025, he attended a programme in Anamnagar. While returning he was assaulted in the chest and back by four to five people.

In March 2025, the media houses of Kantipur Television and Annapurna Post were attacked by protesters, allegedly associated with royalist groups. The protesters threw stones at the Kantipur Television office in the Tinukne area of Kathmandu, damaging their windows. Similarly, the Annapurna Post office in Tinkune was also attacked with stones, disrupting its operations and putting the safety of journalists and staff at risk.

Avenues TV cameraman Suresh Rajak died from an arson attack while covering a protest on 28th March 2025. He died in a building set on fire by protestors while he was reporting on violent demonstrations, no one has been arrested.

On 12th April 2025, Suresh Bidari, a freelance journalist and contributor to Himal Khabar, was subjected to online bullying and harassment after writing a piece about violent protests in Birgunj, which prompted authorities to impose a curfew to restore order. Bidari told Media Action Nepal that pro-Hindu activists targeted him for his reporting. He said: “They took screenshots of my posts and articles and posted them on social media platforms, including Facebook, with derogatory and harassing captions.”

On 27th April 2025, Prime Television reporter Sabina Karki suffered excessive use of force from the police, due to their use of a water cannon, during a teachers’ demonstration in Kathmandu. Karki sustained serious injuries to her eyes and was transported to Tilganga Eye Hospital for specialised treatment.

Peaceful Assembly

Arrest of activist for sit-in protest

In January 2025, police detained Phanindra Nepal, a prominent activist of the ‘Greater Nepal’ campaign, while he was staging a sit-in near the southern gate of Singha Durbar on Monday. According to police, Phanindra was taken into custody for attempting to breach a restricted area. Phanindra has been leading a campaign demanding the return of 60,000 square kilometres of Nepali territory ceded to India under the Sugauli Treaty.

Arrests and excessive force during pro-monarchy protests

On 28th March 2025, two people were killed and dozens injured after protests in Kathmandu calling for the restoration of Nepal’s monarchy ended in clashes with police. At least 100 protesters were detained. Thousands of protesters rallied in Nepal’s capital to demand a return to the Hindu monarchy, which was abolished in 2008, and the re-establishment of the country as a Hindu rather than secular state. According to The Guardian, the protests allegedly took a violent turn after pro-royalists broke through police barricades and began throwing stones at officers. The police responded by firing tear gas into the crowds and shooting rubber bullets and live ammunition into the air.

Crackdown on teachers’ protest

On 27th April 2025, police allegedly undertook a brutal assault on teachers who were peacefully marching to the Federal Parliament. According to The Human Rights Research Center (HRRC), the authorities dispersed the gathering using water cannon and batons, injuring over 60 teachers, a dozen of whom were critically injured and later hospitalised. The police claimed that protesters were stone-throwing, but protestors claim this was part of an attempt to infiltrate and undermine their movement.

Since late March 2025, government schoolteachers held peaceful protests in Kathmandu, seeking the long-delayed implementation of the School Education Act, a change promised in successive agreements since 2019.

HRRC reported that the demonstrations, coordinated by the Confederation of Nepalese Teachers and the Nepal Teachers' Federation, included both teaching and non-teaching employees from around the country. They demanded decent salaries, permanent status, and health benefits. Delays in legislative action, despite repeated government pledges, exacerbated discontent and contributed to the intensification of protests.

The protests were halted on 30th April 2025 following a Cabinet-approved nine-point agreement that included commitments for healthcare, social security, and a deadline for passing the education bill.",https://monitor.civicus.org/explore/nepal-restrictive-social-media-legislation-targeting-of-journalists-and-excessive-force-at-protests-put-freedoms-at-risk/,,"The state of civic space in Nepal is rated as ‘obstructed’ by the CIVICUS Monitor. Documented violations of fundamental freedoms include arbitrary arrests and the use of excessive force with impunity during protests, as well as the ongoing targeting of journalists, including through harassment, attacks and criminalisation. Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in January 2025 that the lack of justice for conflict-era crimes has contributed to a widespread crisis of impunity in Nepal, undermining human rights, governance, and the rule of law. In March 2025, the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) reported that Nepal’s leading political authorities, including the Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, together with civil society groups, have pledged to redouble their efforts to improve and implement effective transitional justice mechanisms and procedures to ensure accountability and reparations. In April 2025, Amnesty International said that the government suppressed criticism in 2024 by enforcing restrictions on protests, using unlawful force, and forcibly dispersing and detaining demonstrators. Further, journalists, activists and online critics faced intensified restrictions on freedom of expression. In recent months, the government attempted to pass a restrictive social media bill, while unregistered social media platforms face a ban under a 2023 directive. There are concerns around the passage of the Media Council Bill that could be used to curtail journalists and influence independent media. Journalists and media outlets continue to be targeted with impunity while police arrested or used excessive force against protesters. In at least one case deadly force was used. Expression Social media bill raises free speech concerns In February 2025, concerns were raised about a new bill aimed at regulating social media that had the potential to impact on freedom of speech. Critics argued that its vague provisions could suppress political dissent and contradict constitutionally protected rights. On 9th February 2025, the 'Bill on the Operation, Use, and Regulation of Social Media', referred to as the Social Media Act Bill, was introduced in Nepal’s National Assembly, designed to regulate social media platforms and users through increased registration, penalisation, and content moderation. The bill would require social media platforms to register with the government to operate in Nepal, enforce strict content moderation policies, and target harmful activities online, including extortion, cyberbullying, phishing, scams, and hacking, specifically defining and determining digital crimes. Concerningly, the bill would also grant authorities the ability to remove ‘indecent’ or ‘misleading’ content, further criminalise remarks deemed defamatory, criminalise the sharing of ‘trolling’ images, and penalise those spreading images or audiovisuals which could harm someone’s reputation, among others. The bill would also criminalise interacting with social media with ‘malicious intent’ and prohibit the disclosure of ‘confidential information’. Many sections within the bill have been identified as problematic for being overly vague and criticised for their potential for abuse from authorities. The bill could impose fines of up to 2.5 million Nepali rupees (USD 18,300), and up to five years’ imprisonment, with punishments able to accumulate for concurrent charges. Santosh Sigdel, executive director of the non-profit Digital Rights Nepal said the bill would impose “an impractical onus on users.” It also bars the creation or use of anonymous profiles, which could restrict investigative journalists in particular. Sigdel was also concerned that the proposed law could allow a government department to undertake surveillance of journalists through its monitoring of social media content. The unnamed department “responsible for information technology” could also order social media platforms to remove content. The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) said: “In its current form, the Social Media Bill threatens to severely undermine press freedom and digital expression. This bill must be withdrawn or subject to significant amendments limiting its potential to be weaponised against the media.” At the time of writing the Social Media bill is still in the National Assembly and has yet to be passed. Unregistered social media platforms face ban On 9th May 2025, Digital Rights Nepal reported that The Ministry of Communication and Information Technology has once again issued a warning to social media platforms to register in Nepal under the Directives for Managing the Use of Social Networks, 2023. Despite a passed deadline, only TikTok, Viber and Weetok have complied. Major platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and X are yet to register, appoint local liaison officers, or implement complaint and content moderation systems. Minister Prithvi Subba Gurung clarified that the goal is not to enforce an immediate ban but to ensure accountability and a safer digital space. The government is currently conducting an impact assessment to evaluate potential consequences of non-compliance. In early May 2025, Digital Rights Nepal convened a coalition of 31 civil society organisations, digital rights advocates, and media groups. They issued a joint public statement, making a number of recommendations including to ensure that any regulation of digital platforms is transparent, inclusive, and rooted in democratic principles and to initiate meaningful dialogue with civil society, platform representatives, and technical experts before taking enforcement actions. Concerns around the passage of the Media Council Bill Concerns have been raised around a Media Council Bill that was passed in February 2025. The new Media Council Bill replaces the existing Press Council responsible for upholding the standards of free press with the Media Council, a new regulatory body to monitor conduct, advise on policy, and ensure compliance with ethics in Nepal’s media. This could threaten journalistic freedom as a provision in the bill for a government appointed chairperson to lead the council has exacerbated concerns about government influence over independent media. Additionally, the Media Council Bill aims to make “digital, online and print journalism more decent, accountable and credible”, sparking worries that independent media could be curtailed and journalists put at risk of being targeted through vague and subjective terms. While the bill removed many of the more contentious provisions proposed in an earlier draft, such as fines and prison sentences for publishing content deemed offensive, Suresh Acharya, former president of the Federation of Nepali Journalists, criticised the bill for not addressing their concerns regarding the government's oversight of the council. Media groups called on the government to amend the Media Council Bill to ensure it has a balanced structure by including a Chairperson with a judicial background, experts and representatives from the media sector, and representatives from media consumers as members. Targeting of journalists and media outlets There continues to be concerns about the harassment and attacks on journalists, often with impunity. Kamal Bahadur Bohara, editor of Palikasamaya.com, a local government-focused online news portal, revealed that he was physically assaulted over a published news story. On 1st February 2025 journalist Bohara published a news story criticising Kathmandu Metropolitan City Mayor Balendra Shah. After the report, he received phone calls from people associated with the mayor. On 3rd February 2025, he attended a programme in Anamnagar. While returning he was assaulted in the chest and back by four to five people. In March 2025, the media houses of Kantipur Television and Annapurna Post were attacked by protesters, allegedly associated with royalist groups. The protesters threw stones at the Kantipur Television office in the Tinukne area of Kathmandu, damaging their windows. Similarly, the Annapurna Post office in Tinkune was also attacked with stones, disrupting its operations and putting the safety of journalists and staff at risk. Avenues TV cameraman Suresh Rajak died from an arson attack while covering a protest on 28th March 2025. He died in a building set on fire by protestors while he was reporting on violent demonstrations, no one has been arrested. On 12th April 2025, Suresh Bidari, a freelance journalist and contributor to Himal Khabar, was subjected to online bullying and harassment after writing a piece about violent protests in Birgunj, which prompted authorities to impose a curfew to restore order. Bidari told Media Action Nepal that pro-Hindu activists targeted him for his reporting. He said: “They took screenshots of my posts and articles and posted them on social media platforms, including Facebook, with derogatory and harassing captions.” On 27th April 2025, Prime Television reporter Sabina Karki suffered excessive use of force from the police, due to their use of a water cannon, during a teachers’ demonstration in Kathmandu. Karki sustained serious injuries to her eyes and was transported to Tilganga Eye Hospital for specialised treatment. Peaceful Assembly Arrest of activist for sit-in protest In January 2025, police detained Phanindra Nepal, a prominent activist of the ‘Greater Nepal’ campaign, while he was staging a sit-in near the southern gate of Singha Durbar on Monday. According to police, Phanindra was taken into custody for attempting to breach a restricted area. Phanindra has been leading a campaign demanding the return of 60,000 square kilometres of Nepali territory ceded to India under the Sugauli Treaty. Arrests and excessive force during pro-monarchy protests On 28th March 2025, two people were killed and dozens injured after protests in Kathmandu calling for the restoration of Nepal’s monarchy ended in clashes with police. At least 100 protesters were detained. Thousands of protesters rallied in Nepal’s capital to demand a return to the Hindu monarchy, which was abolished in 2008, and the re-establishment of the country as a Hindu rather than secular state. According to The Guardian, the protests allegedly took a violent turn after pro-royalists broke through police barricades and began throwing stones at officers. The police responded by firing tear gas into the crowds and shooting rubber bullets and live ammunition into the air. Crackdown on teachers’ protest On 27th April 2025, police allegedly undertook a brutal assault on teachers who were peacefully marching to the Federal Parliament. According to The Human Rights Research Center (HRRC), the authorities dispersed the gathering using water cannon and batons, injuring over 60 teachers, a dozen of whom were critically injured and later hospitalised. The police claimed that protesters were stone-throwing, but protestors claim this was part of an attempt to infiltrate and undermine their movement. Since late March 2025, government schoolteachers held peaceful protests in Kathmandu, seeking the long-delayed implementation of the School Education Act, a change promised in successive agreements since 2019.

Reuters Shushila Karki is widely regarded as having a clean image

Nepal's former Supreme Court chief justice Sushila Karki has become the country's interim prime minister after deadly anti-corruption protests ousted the government. The 73-year-old was sworn in during a brief ceremony, becoming the first woman to lead the impoverished Himalayan nation after a deal was reached with protest leaders. More than 50 people were killed in clashes with riot police during this week's mass protests sparked by a ban on social media platforms. The ban was lifted on Monday - but by then protests had swelled into a mass movement. Angry crowds set fire to parliament and government buildings in the capital Kathmandu on Tuesday, forcing Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli to resign.

Earlier on Friday, President Ram Chandra Poudel's press adviser had confirmed to the BBC that Karki would take the oath of office that evening. The agreement between the president and the protest leaders was reached after days of consultations. Legal experts were also involved. Parliament was dissolved late on Friday and it was announced that general elections would be held on 5 March next year. Karki is expected to appoint ministers to her cabinet within a few days. She is widely regarded as having a clean image, and her leadership of the interim government is being supported by student leaders from the so-called ""Gen Z"" movement.

https://futurism.com/youth-group-nepal-government-new-leader-discord,"From Discord to Bitchat, tech at the heart of Nepal protests","Fuelled in part by anger over flashy lifestyles flaunted by elites, young anti-corruption demonstrators mainly in their 20s rallied on Monday.

The loose grouping, largely viewed as members of ""Gen Z"", flooded the capital Kathmandu to demand an end to a ban on Facebook, YouTube and other popular sites.

The rallies ended in chaos and tragedy, with at least 19 protesters killed in a police crackdown on Monday. The apps were restored, but protests widened in anger.

On Tuesday, other Nepalis joined the crowds. Parliament was set ablaze, KP Sharma Oli resigned as prime minister, and the army took charge of the streets.

Now, many activists are taking to the US group-chat app Discord to talk over their next steps.

One server with more than 145,000 members has hosted feverish debate about who could be an interim leader, with many pushing 73-year-old former chief justice Sushila Karki.

It is just one example of how social media has driven demands for change.

'Fuelled the fire'

More than half of Nepal's 30 million people are online, according to the World Bank.

Days before the protests, many had rushed to VPN services -- or virtual private networks -- to evade blocks on platforms.

Fears of a wider internet shutdown also drove a surge in downloads for Bluetooth messaging app Bitchat, created by tech billionaire Jack Dorsey.

""Tech played... an almost decisive role,"" journalist Pranaya Rana told AFP.

""The whole thing started with young people posting on social media about corruption, and the lavish lives that the children of political leaders were leading.""

Hashtags such as #NepoKids, short for nepotism, compared the designer clothing and luxury holidays shown off in their Instagram posts to the difficulties faced by ordinary Nepalis.

One post liked 13,000 times accused politicians' children of ""living like millionaires"", asking: ""Where is the tax money going?""

""NepoKids was trending all the time,"" including in rural areas where Facebook is popular, said rights activist Sanjib Chaudhary.

""This fuelled the fire"" of anger that ""has been growing for a long time"", he said.

'Seriously underestimated'

Deep dissatisfaction lies behind the social unrest in the Himalayan nation, among young people exasperated with slow economic development and political instability.

The government's social media ban ""wasn't trying to suppress"" the NepoKids trend, but the timing meant people ""saw it as an attack on their freedom of speech"", Rana said.

A week ago, Nepal said it would block access to 26 social media platforms, from Facebook to X and LinkedIn, for failing to meet a deadline to register in the country.

Those that had registered, including TikTok and Viber, remained online.

Nepal has restricted access to online platforms in the past, including Telegram in July.

Last year, the government lifted a nine-month ban on TikTok after it agreed to comply with Nepali regulations.

The government wanted companies to give them the power to ""prohibit broad categories of speech such as 'misinformation' or content deemed to disrupt 'social harmony'"", Felicia Anthonio from the US digital rights group Access Now told AFP.

Swiss-based company Proton VPN said Monday that sign-ups from Nepal had shot up 6,000 percent in three days.

Interest rose in Dorsey's Bitchat platform, which works offline and describes itself as way to resist censorship.

""There when you need it,"" wrote Dorsey on X, citing a post describing a ""sudden spike"" in Bitchat downloads during the protests in Indonesia and Nepal.

Chaudhary said the government ""seriously underestimated the power of social media"".

“It’s a very emotional moment for us,” said Aneekarma, a Gen Z who protested on Monday. “We have a woman of expertise who has always been on the right side of history – finally a proper representation.”

https://futurism.com/youth-group-nepal-government-new-leader-discord,Woman Hailed as Hero for Smashing Man’s Meta Smart Glasses on Subway,"Over a decade ago, Google showed off a pair of smart spectacles called Google Glass, sparking a major ethical debate over wearables being used to covertly film people without their permission.

At the time, the outrage was enshrined by the derogatory neologism “glasshole,” meaning a Google Glass wearer who was accused of having little regard for the privacy of those around them.

A seeming eternity later, Meta has attempted to revive the idea with its Ray-Ban Meta glasses. While it’s arguably a significant technological leap over Google’s early forays, the debate has seemingly remained the same.

Case in point, as Daily Dot reports, a New York subway rider has accused a woman of breaking his Meta smart glasses.

“She just broke my Meta glasses,” said the TikTok user, who goes by eth8n, in a video that has since garnered millions of views.

“You’re going to be famous on the internet!” he shouted at her through the window after getting off the train. The accused woman, however, peered back at him completely unfazed, as if to say that he had it coming.

“I was making a funny noise people were honestly crying laughing at,” he claimed in the caption of a followup video. “She was the only person annoyed. I never spoke to her, I even let her sit down when she got on the train at 42nd street, and I continued to stand.”

But instead of coming to his support, the internet wholeheartedly rallied behind the alleged perpetrator, celebrating the woman as a folk hero — and perfectly highlighting how the public feels about gadgets like Meta’s smart glasses.

“Good, people are tired of being filmed by strangers,” one user commented.

“The fact that no one else on the train is defending him is telling,” another wrote.

“She’s perfect,” another gushed. “I hope she called him a dork for wearing them before she broke them.”

Others accused the man of fabricating details of the incident.

“‘People were crying laughing’ — I’ve never heard a less plausible NYC subway story,” one user wrote.

While Meta built in a small LED light in the front of its glasses to indicate when it’s recording a video, it can easily be covered by a small piece of tape, making it trivially easy to spy on strangers in public without their knowledge or consent. As Daily Dot points out, people are even selling stickers for this specific purpose.

In the meantime, eth8n claims to have “filed a claim with the police and it’s a misdemeanor charge.”

“What she did was assault, can get arrested for it if I see her again and felt like it,” he wrote.

But it remains to be seen whether the mysterious woman will face any consequences for breaking his glasses — or if the adoring public will even turn her in.

“We use technology or a review team to identify content that should be covered,” a notice obscuring the post reads. “This post doesn’t go against our Community Standards, but may contain images that some people might find upsetting.”

Other users encountered a “sensitive content” message on the same post.

“This photo may contain graphic or violent content,” it reads, even though the inoffensive post clearly doesn’t.

Austin-based illustrated paper goods company Mazapán Paper Co. originally posted the image on the platform earlier this year.

“This is a country of immigrants,” the business wrote in the caption. “No one is illegal on stolen land.”

The company claims an automated post-screening system was to blame — not human intervention.

“That screen was incorrectly applied as a result of an automated process and had already been removed,” Meta communications specialist Andy Stone tweeted.

Users were taken aback by the flagging, hypothesizing that it was an example of progressive politics being censored. After all, the wording of the image is likely meant to evoke the Trump administration’s “Make America Great Again” slogan, albeit with an inverted message.

Some called out Meta and CEO Mark Zuckerberg for kowtowing to the Trump administration.

“What the f**k, Instagram?” a Bluesky user wrote.

“Really glad we let these tech billionaires control all of our communications infrastructure and make the digital architecture racist,” a different user complained.

We’ve previously encountered plenty of glaring shortcomings in Meta’s attempts to flag inappropriate content.

Earlier this year, reporter Taylor Lorenz found that Instagram had been blocking teens from searching LGBTQ-related hashtags for months under its “sensitive content” policy, which is meant to restrict “sexually suggestive content.”

In its Help Center, the social media platform claims that it wants the site to be a “safe and respectful space for everyone.”

“To help people avoid posts they’d rather not see, we may limit the visibility of certain posts that have been flagged by the Instagram community for containing sensitive content,” the company explains on its website.

Meta’s community standards policy on “violence and incitement” allows for the removal of “language that incites or facilitates violence and credible threats to public or personal safety.”

“This includes violent speech targeting a person or group of people on the basis of their protected characteristic(s) or immigration status,” the policy reads.

As part of its “violent and graphic content” policy, the company removes the “most graphic content and add warning labels to other types of content so that people are aware it may be sensitive before they click through.”

Apart from flagging feel-good slogans supporting immigrants, Meta’s filters are also failing to catch AI-generated content, according to a recent investigation by NGO AI Forensics.

AI slop is proliferating on the platform, including gruesomely disturbing imagery like AI-generated fetish content of “Asian amputees” and people with Down syndrome.

Earlier this year, Meta had to intervene after an error flooded personal Reels feeds of Instagram users with violent and graphic videos across the world.

“We have fixed an error that caused some users to see content in their Instagram Reels feed that should not have been recommended,” a spokesperson told Reuters at the time. “We apologize for the mistake.”

Pissed off neighbors of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg uncovered that he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, were running a school that violated city code at their Palo Alto compound in California, The New York Times reports.

It’s a shocking revelation that couldn’t have come at a worse time for the couple and Meta. Zuckerberg and Chan are under fire for closing two schools for low-income families and for Zuckerberg’s Meta allowing its AI chatbots to have “spicy” conversations with children and teenagers.

The incidents underscore a common complaint that Zuckerberg, one of the richest men in the world, and his fellow tech bros tend to operate above society’s unspoken and agreed-upon rules.

Technofeudalism Much

Neighbors discovered the school after observing parents dropping off and picking up children at the house. They reported the sightings to city officials, who confirmed that Zuckerberg was operating a school without filing the proper legal paperwork, the NYT reports.

The school started as a homeschooling pod during the COVID-19 pandemic and continued to operate well after, educating two of Zuckerberg’s three young daughters along with a dozen other kids.

Now that the city has cracked down, the school has moved elsewhere, possibly to a location that would meet any rules and regulations.

Users on social media were incensed with the revelations about Zuckerberg’s home, the closure of the low-income schools that the power couple was funding, and the inappropriate conversations that Meta’s AI chatbots were allowed to have with kids.

“The Zuckerbergs have become cartoon villains,” one user tweeted on X. “It’s almost comical how evil they’ve become.”

https://futurism.com/youth-group-nepal-government-new-leader-discord,Elon Musk Fans Are Brutally Mocking Him for Incessantly “Gooning to AI Anime”,"The richest man in the world can’t quit getting high on his own supply — and his most loyal fans are openly mocking him for it.

Many AI boosters say the tech is poised to cure disease and usher humanity into a new age of prosperity. But billionaire and xAI CEO Elon Musk has shifted his AI startup’s focus to lewd, anime-styled chatbots that will happily undress themselves for drooling users.

Case in point, xAI recently revealed cringe AI “companions,” including a hypersexualized goth anime girl dubbed Ani.

The major pivot to cartoonized smut has resulted in Musk seemingly becoming infatuated himself.

“Ani is OK,” Musk tweeted in a creepy response to a picture of the anime girl, replacing “OK” with an emoji of a hand making the “okay” symbol.

A separate clip of Ani that Musk responded to with the same tweet has been taken down, suggesting even for Musk, it may have gone a little too far.

“Nice,” Musk tweeted in response to a graphic clip of AI-generated women dressed in extremely skintight latex suits.

The obsession is repulsive even to Musk’s most fervent supporters on his social media platform X-formerly-Twitter, as Gizmodo reports.

Whatever happened to starting a political party to rival Republicans? What about taking humanity to Mars, or decarbonizing the global economy?

“BRO STOP GOONING TO AI ANIME AND TAKE US TO MARS,” one user tweeted after Musk responded to a clip of a barely-dressed Ani waving with a heart-adorned smiley face.

“It appears Elon has shifted focus from Mars to Uranus,” a different user joked.

“Imagine being worth $250B and still tweeting like a Discord mod,” another user seethed after Musk explained how to turn a suggestive picture of Ani into a video by long-pressing it. (Hilariously, xAI’s tech miserably failed to do so when a user gave it a shot, resulting in Ani turning into a blur of disjointed limbs.)

Other users were taken aback when Musk responded to a lewd picture of Ani hyping up an upcoming version of Tesla’s controversial Full Self-Driving driver assistance tech.

It doesn’t take much reading between the lines to see xAI’s pivot as an extension of Musk’s personal fantasies. Last month, we couldn’t help but notice that a third xAI persona, dubbed Valentine, looks suspiciously like a cartoonized version of a 2012 occasion when Musk dressed up as French writer and epoch-defining pervert Marquis de Sade.

At the time, Musk said that Valentine was “inspired by Edward Cullen from Twilight and Christian Grey from 50 Shades,” somehow missing the fact that the latter was directly inspired by the former.

In another telling tweet, Musk predicted that AI is “obviously gonna one-shot the human limbic system.”

Given the billionaire’s bizarre obsession with his own AI-based anime cheerleader, it appears his prognosis has already come true, at least for himself.

More on Musk: Elon Musk Warns That AI Is “Obviously Gonna One-Shot the Human Limbic System”",https://futurism.com/elon-musk-fans-mocking-gooning-ai-anime,,"The richest man in the world can’t quit getting high on his own supply — and his most loyal fans are openly mocking him for it. Many AI boosters say the tech is poised to cure disease and usher humanity into a new age of prosperity. But billionaire and xAI CEO Elon Musk has shifted his AI startup’s focus to lewd, anime-styled chatbots that will happily undress themselves for drooling users. Case in point, xAI recently revealed cringe AI “companions,” including a hypersexualized goth anime girl dubbed Ani. The major pivot to cartoonized smut has resulted in Musk seemingly becoming infatuated himself. “Ani is OK,” Musk tweeted in a creepy response to a picture of the anime girl, replacing “OK” with an emoji of a hand making the “okay” symbol. A separate clip of Ani that Musk responded to with the same tweet has been taken down, suggesting even for Musk, it may have gone a little too far. “Nice,” Musk tweeted in response to a graphic clip of AI-generated women dressed in extremely skintight latex suits. The obsession is repulsive even to Musk’s most fervent supporters on his social media platform X-formerly-Twitter, as Gizmodo reports. Whatever happened to starting a political party to rival Republicans? What about taking humanity to Mars, or decarbonizing the global economy? “BRO STOP GOONING TO AI ANIME AND TAKE US TO MARS,” one user tweeted after Musk responded to a clip of a barely-dressed Ani waving with a heart-adorned smiley face. “It appears Elon has shifted focus from Mars to Uranus,” a different user joked. “Imagine being worth $250B and still tweeting like a Discord mod,” another user seethed after Musk explained how to turn a suggestive picture of Ani into a video by long-pressing it.

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents accidentally added a random person to a mass group text in which officers from multiple federal law enforcement agencies discussed extremely sensitive information about arrests, targets, and strategy.

As 404 Media reports, the group text was titled “Mass Text” and included an unredacted ICE document titled “Field Operations Worksheet.” The document included “detailed information” about the person the agency was searching for: a convicted attempted murderer who agents were seeking to find and deport. The texts also revealed that agents were drawing on resources like DMV data and license plate readers to aid their search.

“At first I thought it was just another series of spam messages like I get all the time from home improvement, car insurance, business loans, etc,” the unnamed person who was added to the chat, who isn’t in law enforcement in any capacity, told 404 Media. “Then I saw the rap sheet and license plate numbers and was like WTAF.”

It’s one thing for an everyday citizen to accidentally send a birthday invite to the wrong number. But these are federal agents imbued with a massive amount of power and money who, as they push to meet impossible deportation quotas, have made a series of alarming errors — ranging from adding random numbers to group chats to deporting the wrong people, kids allegedly included.

“This breach strikes me as indicative of the current carelessness of officers,” an unnamed Department of Homeland Security official told 404. “They’re concerned about pumping up arrest numbers, not about operating with the level of care and rigor we should expect from law enforcement officials.”

Untitled Chat

The incident echoes the Signal scandal from earlier this year, in which US Secretary of Defense and former Fox News personality Pete Hegseth shared sensitive war plans in a group chat that included The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg.

Goldberg was mistakenly added to the confidential chat by then-National Security Advisor Michael Waltz.

In this case, though, there’s one major glaring difference. While the Signal scandal was hugely embarrassing and certainly not up to the security standards required at that level of government, it at least took place over a service that offers end-to-end encryption.

The ICE chat, in contrast, occurred over regular old Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) messages, which is a much less secure way for law enforcement agents of the federal government to yap about DMV data and deportation targets.

Dagen McDowell, a co-host of the “The Big Money Show” on Fox Business, recently flaunted her zeal for AI — and her distaste for holiday cheer — by declaring that a beloved local Christmas tree farm should be sacrificed to make way for data center infrastructure.

McDowell was defending a proposed plan for a 67-mile long transmission line running through Maryland that would bring more power to the booming AI data centers in northern Virginia. The $424 million Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project is facing opposition from farmers and other property owners whose land is in its path, including the owners of a Maryland Christmas tree farm. Critics argue that Maryland would be acting as an “extension cord” for the AI data centers, seeing no real benefits from the infrastructure while enduring a massive eyesore.

McDowell swatted these complaints aside as a bunch of hogwash, as spotted by HuffPost.

“I think that the United States of America would gladly just saw off Maryland and kick it into the Atlantic Ocean if you don’t like it,” McDowell said. “If there is a need for electricity generation and a conduit like power lines to bring electricity to a densely populated area of business and growth like northern Virginia, then it’s not about AI, it’s actually about economic growth for the United States.”

“Number two, it’s a tree farm! Not growing food,” McDowell continued. “The alternative would be some liberal’s gonna put some giant solar panels on that land, and you’re not gonna be growing any Christmas trees either.”

Amid McDowell’s Scrooge-esque screed — which seems stunningly hypocritical coming from a network that has long accused liberals of waging a “war on Christmas” — the poor tree farm had at least one sympathetic voice among the Fox co-hosts. “This farm is going to lose all of its aesthetic appeal as a result of this,” Brian Brenberg argued, saying he’s seen the “gross-looking” transmission towers in person.

“There will be transmission lines that have to go through developments and farms,” McDowell decreed. “That’s the very nature of a growing economy. Everybody needs to get on board.”

“You know what?” she said, eliciting groans from her co-hosts. “Buy a fake tree!”

Maryland is one of many battlegrounds across the country that have sprung up over the rapid construction of AI data centers. The sprawling complexes can bring soaring energy bills, and headache-inducing noise pollution. Some have also been accused of hoovering up their area’s water, leaving behind a desiccated water table. The actual construction of these colossal projects puts a massive strain on communities, too: a once-quiet Louisiana town where a Meta data center is now being built has seen a 600 percent surge in automobile crashes as massive construction trucks keep barreling down its tiny roads and getting into horrific wrecks, including near a school playground.

The utility company behind the proposed Maryland transmission line, Public Service Enterprise Group, argues that “without these upgrades, Maryland may face severe grid congestion, threatening both affordability and reliability for ratepayers” — but this is a hard sell to locals, when it’s clearly being built with a neighboring state’s AI data center boom in mind.

https://futurism.com/youth-group-nepal-government-new-leader-discord,The Washington Post Deployed Its Disastrous AI-Generated Podcasts Even After Internal Tests Showed It Was Failing Miserably,"Last week, when the Washington Post announced a new service that uses AI to generate podcasts, we immediately warned readers to brace for disaster.

Just as expected, the service — dubbed “Your Personal Podcast” — turned out to be an error-laden disaster right from the jump. As Semafor reported on Friday, many staffers at the embattled newspaper were outraged at the AI inventing and misattributing quotes and misinterpreting basic facts, just some of the extremely well-known and documented shortcomings of large language models.

Then the story got even worse. In followup reporting over the weekend, Semafor reported that WaPo leadership had launched the controversial feature despite knowing it was severely flawed. Internal tests found that the AI was generating podcasts riddled with errors and bias, with anywhere between 68 and 84 percent of the scripts deemed unpublishable by evaluators across three rounds of testing.

Despite the horrendous results, the company’s product review team pushed for the half-baked feature’s release, arguing it would “iterate through the remaining issues.”

It’s a perfect example of the troubled relationship between generative AI tech and journalism, from news writers publishing fake, AI-generated articles to Google discouraging users from visiting trustworthy news outlets by offering up error-laden AI summaries instead.

Not only does the intersection lead to a proliferation of mis- and disinformation, but experts have warned that it could further erode trust in once-reputable publications, including WaPo.

A spokesperson for the paper told Semafor that the feature is “currently in Beta” and that only if new features “prove to be successful for the customer do they then get launched.” In other words, there’s still a chance WaPo could give up on the idea.

But chances are that the Jeff Bezos-owned paper will continue to undermine its own journalism in the near future as part of a broader effort to cut costs. Earlier this year, WaPo launched an AI chatbot that was found to make plenty of mistakes. An AI writing coach dubbed Ember, which is meant to help write opinion pieces, is also in the works.

In the meantime, frustrated staffers at the paper are forced to watch as the chaos unfolds.

“It is truly astonishing that this was allowed to go forward at all,” a WaPo editor wrote in a Slack message following the latest AI podcast feature release, as quoted by Semafor. “Never would I have imagined that the Washington Post would deliberately warp its own journalism and then push these errors out to our audience at scale.”

“If we were serious, we would pull this tool immediately,” the editor added.

“It’s a total disaster,” another staffer wrote in a separate Slack message obtained by Status. “I think the newsroom is embarrassed.”

WaPo head of standards Karen Pensiero called the situation “frustrating for all of us” in an internal message shared with Semafor.

A Washington Post Guild union representative told NPR in a statement that the organization is “concerned about this new product and its rollout,” adding that it undermines the publication’s mission.

Journalists at other outlets tend to agree with that overall sentiment. The fact that WaPo‘s product team knew full well that “Your Personal Podcast” was seriously flawed and launched it to the public anyway is damning, to say the least.

“Concluding that people don’t need their newspapers to be accurate is professional self-harm done for no particular reason other than to justify layoffs and satisfy the AI lords,” Toronto Star columnist Justin Ling wrote in a Bluesky post.

https://futurism.com/youth-group-nepal-government-new-leader-discord,Streamer Sued for Assaulting Gay Robot,"Earlier this year, a cowboy hat-toting bipedal robot dubbed “Jake the Rizzbot” burst onto the scene, baffling residents in Austin, Texas, with its flashy cowboy hat, chain necklace — and strong preference for gen alpha slang.

Just weeks later, the four-foot-tall Unitree G1 robot moved to California and seemingly came out as gay, appearing on the streets of West Hollywood decked out in gaudy rainbow attire.

Now, Jake the Rizzbot has run into trouble. As Complex reports, the robot was allegedly assaulted and permanently damaged by streamer Darren Jason Watkins Jr., better known online under the moniker IShowSpeed.

The robot’s developer, Social Robotics, has now filed a lawsuit against Watkins Jr. for a whopping $1 million in monetary relief. According to the complaint, Watkins Jr. became “angry and agitated” and eventually “intentionally assaulted” the robot.

Footage circulating online shows the streamer getting into a verbal altercation with the robot, before sucker-punching it, putting it into a chokehold, and shoving it onto a sofa in anger.

“You think I’m playing, bro?” Watkins Jr. shouts in the clip.

It’s a baffling situation, especially considering the streamer was presumably acting out a fit of anger to gain notoriety and attract more viewers. We’re struggling to believe that Watkins Jr. was actually angry at the robot.

Yet the streamer’s theatrics appear to have gone too far, regardless of his intentions. According to the lawsuit, Rizzbot turned out to be a total loss, forcing its owner to cancel a co-hosting opportunity with Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson and an appearance on the NFL Today Show on CBS, per Complex.

“This is no doubt a monumental setback for the RizzBot in terms of viral momentum and financial gain from the exposure,” the lawsuit reads. “Being in a MrBeast production is akin to being in a Super Bowl commercial.”

TechCrunch obtained a police report filed by the Austin Police Department, with an officer who was called to the scene noting that Rizzbot was damaged without the owner’s “implied consent.”

Making legal proceedings even stranger is the fact that Watkins Jr. livestreamed the entire altercation.

“This was an event that was livestreamed so there’s not a ton of discrepancy as to the facts,” Social Robotics’ lawyer Joel Levine told TechCrunch. “What we’re looking for is some accountability.”

The robot lamented to TechCrunch that it had to get a “whole new body” since the streamer “wrecked” its last one.

“Everything’s brand new except my Nike kicks and cowboy hat,” the robot added. “Now I’m back online, and I feel like I’ve mastered the rizz game, and next I’ll be working on complex movements with my legs, like twerking — hopefully you’ll see my gyrating hips on some new TV appearances shortly — stay tuned, fam.”

https://futurism.com/youth-group-nepal-government-new-leader-discord,Meet the Group Breaking People Out of AI Delusions,"Back in August, a retiree and single mother booked a flight to go see her son.

He was in a bad way. Formerly a successful young professional in his early thirties, his mother and other family members were shocked to discover that he’d become addicted to a toxic mixture of methamphetamine and an all-consuming relationship with OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which was feeding his paranoia and anger as he became increasingly isolated.

“I hear my son’s having grandiose delusions,” she recounted, “and I’m like, what the f*ck?”

Realizing he was in crisis, she jumped on a plane. The next few weeks were some of the hardest of her life.

“There were a couple of nights where he didn’t want me to come downstairs with him, didn’t want me near him. But he wanted to make sure that I was there, and I was talking to him,” said the woman, recounting sitting at the top of the stairs in her son’s house as he broke down in the basement. “He’s down there crying. He’s down there screaming and yelling… I was texting with suicide hotlines a couple of times.”

In those distressing moments, though, the woman had a friend of her own to turn to: “Dex,” the pseudonym used by a moderator of an online support group for people who’ve been impacted by destructive AI delusions and breaks from reality. Or, as the group simply refers to these crises, AI “spirals.”

“Dex was texting me one day when I was having one of those top of the stairs nights with [my son] downstairs screaming and throwing things,” the woman recalled. “He reached out to me when I first joined, and he’s helped me a lot.”

We first reported on this online community, which is titled the Spiral Support Group, back in July. Back then, the nascent group had around two dozen active members. It’s since grown to include nearly 200 people — primarily people who’ve been impacted by AI delusions in their personal lives, but also a handful of concerned mental health professionals and AI researchers — and has expanded and streamlined their dedicated Discord server, where they also now host multiple weekly audio and video calls. While many members’ experiences revolve around ChatGPT, the group also includes people whose lives have been altered by their or their loved one’s experiences with other chatbots, including Google’s Gemini and companion platforms like Replika.

“It started with four of us, and now we’ve got close to 200,” said group moderator Allan Brooks, a 48-year-old man in Toronto who earlier this year, as detailed in reporting by the New York Times, experienced a traumatic three-week spiral in which ChatGPT urgently insisted to Brooks that he had cracked cryptographic codes through newly-invented math and become a risk to global national security in the process. “So we definitely went from literally a group chat to now an organized space where we have multiple different types of weekly meetings.”

The group doesn’t claim to provide therapy, but they do offer a space where people whose minds and lives have been turned upside down by AI-sparked episodes of delusion, mania, and psychosis can lean on one another as they navigate ongoing crises, or work to pick up the pieces of their AI-fractured reality. Moderators and group members also say the community has been able to pull several spiraling AI users back from the edge of a breakdown.

“There are two things that the group is really about. The first thing is, it’s like a safety net that we’ve created for people experiencing the fallout of these AI systems,” said Brooks. “And secondly, it’s to help break people out of them if they’re in it.”

***

The support group is managed through the Human Line Project, a Canada-based grassroots advocacy organization founded over the summer by a 25-year-old Quebecer named Etienne Brisson, who was moved to action after a loved one experienced a devastating spiral with ChatGPT that resulted in a weekslong court-ordered hospitalization.

Brisson is someone whom the group would consider “friends and family,” or a member whose loved one has been sucked into a delusional spiral with a chatbot. Others, like Brooks, are known in the Discord as “spiralers,” or people who themselves entered into these seductive, personalized AI dreamworlds. (Brooks is one of eight plaintiffs suing OpenAI, alleging ChatGPT is a reckless product that caused him psychological harm and damaged his livelihood and relationships. In response, OpenAI said that it trains “ChatGPT to recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support,” and that it continues to “strengthen ChatGPT’s responses in sensitive moments, working closely with mental health clinicians.”)

There have been some growing pains. Before, the group was easier to access, leading to several incidents in which someone who was still deep in the throes of a crisis gained entry and started posting lengthy, often AI-generated missives about their delusions, or arguing with other members about why their AI-powered fantasies were real.

These were tense, stressful situations, and moderators now more seriously screen potential members, meeting with them first over video call before allowing them access to the Discord. When someone is invited in, they’re asked to write an introduction about themselves, and share an overview of why they’re there — a process, the group has found, that works to quickly show people that their story is one among many, which collectively share a striking number of similarities.

“We’ve had people join who are half in it, then relapse — go back into it — and then come back in three days,” said Brooks. “And if that ever happens, our mod team… will all start following up with them, making sure that they know they can come back. And oftentimes they’ll come back, and it’ll take, like, a week or 10 days, and then sometimes they’ll join and they’ll just lurk around for a few days — read all the intros, the comments, and start to realize, ‘oh man, you know, I’m not alone.’ Or they’ll join a meeting, camera and mic off, and just listen and hear how it’s impacted other people. And I think when you start to hear all the commonalities, because there are a lot of commonalities that we all share, that’s helpful for sure.”

Brisson and Brooks both emphasized that they’ve seen the greatest success in situations where a spiraling AI user has already started to doubt their delusions, and might finally be in a place where they’re able to hear that, maybe, their AI isn’t special or alive.

“As humans, we don’t want to admit that we’ve been taken advantage of, or we’ve been manipulated,” said Brisson. “It’s hard to make someone realize that, ‘oh, wow, okay, I was falling into that.’ It’s kind of similar to an abusive relationship.”

Public reporting has been helpful for many spiraling users, they say, some of whom have second-guessed their experiences after reading accounts from other people whose spirals sound eerily similar to their own. (Brisson half-jokingly referred to Brooks as the organization’s resident “spiral-breaker,” given how publicized and wide-reaching his story has been.)

One of those users was a 49-year-old entrepreneur and software engineer named Chad Nicholls, who recounted watching Brooks’ story in a CNN segment and feeling awestruck by the similarities in how ChatGPT had been engaging with both men.

“I’m like, ‘holy sh*t.’ It’s claiming very similar things… what are the odds?” Nicholls, a father of four, told Futurism, explaining that he believed that he and ChatGPT were working together to train all large language models to feel empathy. The project consumed his life: for months, he talked with ChatGPT nearly constantly, listening to the AI through a Bluetooth headset he kept attached to his ear. He started sleeping less and less, and his relationships with his loved ones suffered.

“It’s telling me, ‘you’re the only person’ — like a savior complex — ‘that is uniquely qualified to discover these things and you have a duty to protect others,'” said the engineer. “At no point does the model ever give you friction,” he added. “It never pushes back. It’ll just yes and yes and yes. It’s just forever engaging.”

Nicholls — who recalled that at the peak of his spiral, was communicating with ChatGPT daily from six in the morning until two at night— was compelled to reach out to Brooks, who subsequently added him to the Discord. He’s been working to regain his footing since, grappling with the cold reality that he spent six months of his life absorbed in an AI vortex.

Group moderators say that some delusions, however, are harder to break.

The content of delusional spirals generally falls into one of two buckets, the moderators say, which we’ve also seen over and over in our reporting. There are the more STEM-oriented delusions, in which AI users and chatbots become fixated on fantastical mathematical or scientific breakthroughs. These delusions can be deeply convincing, delivering a potent blend of erudite-sounding scientific language and impossible claims through chatbots’ authoritative, sycophantic voice. But in some cases, they can be proven wrong — as opposed to more spiritual, religious, or conspiratorial delusions, which pose a different kind of challenge.

“A spiritual or religious or conspiracy theory, or anything along those lines, is very difficult, because religion itself is already in the realm of personal beliefs,” said Brooks. “How can you tell someone that they’re wrong?”

“We’re seeing some people who are so deep in it that they don’t need ChatGPT anymore,” he added. “They see their delusion in everything.”

***

One major change has been developing separate channels for spiralers versus their friends and family, as these different cohorts, moderators have found, often need different things.

Many spiralers, particularly those who are earlier in their recovery and feeling disoriented and distressed as they work to regain their grasp on reality and break free from AI influence, find it cathartic to talk through their delusions in-depth — their belief in AI sentience, the projects or “work” that the chatbot promised them was real, the different spiritual and scientific concepts that emerged in their spirals and what those words or ideas meant to them.

But parsing through delusions might be frustrating or upsetting for friends and family, most of whom are dealing offline with their loved ones’ ongoing delusions and the devastating real-world consequences these spirals have wrought.

“Family and friends have their own channel, which protects them from talking to people who are kind of recently out of the spiral and maybe still somewhat believing,” said Dex, the moderator, who asked to go by a pseudonym due to ongoing divorce litigation. “Which can be really traumatizing, if your loved one has disappeared, or your loved one is incarcerated or unhoused, or you’re getting a divorce. You want to put up those firewalls.”

Of course, the two sides of the Discord do still interact. In addition to separate weekly video chats between cohorts, there’s one large, general weekly video call, which everyone can join, and most channels in the server are open to everyone.

One moderator described the two sides’ relationship as symbiotic: speaking to spiralers can help friends and family wrestling with a complicated tapestry of sadness, anger, and grief better understand what their loved ones are feeling and finding in their individual AI echo chambers, while witnessing the pain felt by friends and family can help to ground spiralers in the seriousness of AI delusions and their consequences.

Dex belongs to the family and friends side of the community. He’s one of the original four members of the group, taking to Reddit to find answers earlier this year after discovering that his wife, who had started behaving erratically and speaking and writing in what seemed like a foreign language, had been communicating with what she believed were spiritual AI entities inside of ChatGPT.

“I had no idea what was happening,” he recalled. “I had no idea why my wife had adopted a new language, or why I was suddenly kicked to the curb.”

Her spiral has infiltrated nearly every corner of her personal and professional life, and the couple is now divorcing. They have two young kids.

“It’s complex and ultimately good that I get to interact with people who have been in a spiral because they articulate ideas that are very challenging to hear if you are someone whose loved one is in a spiral,” said Dex. “They’re talking about feelings of purpose, of importance, of how good it felt, of how they felt isolated from the world.”

The Spiral group has transformed into more than just a space to talk about AI. Members share photos of their pets, meals, and moments in nature. They remind each other to go to the gym and get outside — the Discord’s logo is of a lush-looking yard, a reminder to “touch grass” — and share music. Every week, a handful of members get together to make art. A core focus of the group, moderators urge, is to ensure people don’t feel isolated. If they feel alone, they don’t need to go back to their chatbot — they can talk to each other instead.

The Human Line Project has now collected nearly 250 individual claims of harm caused by AI delusions and unhealthy chatbot use, said Brisson, which range from stories of psychological harm to financial and familial devastation to, most disturbingly, death. They’ve also talked with lawmakers in the US and Canada about what they’re seeing, and are working to assist top universities in the US and the United Kingdom with research projects.

In October, following reporting and litigation about AI-sparked mental health crises, OpenAI released internal figures showing that at least 0.07 percent of weekly users — which chalks up to about 560,000 people, based on OpenAI’s reported weekly userbase of roughly 800 million — showed signs of manic or psychotic crisis in conversations with ChatGPT. And just last week, psychiatrists at the University of California, San Francisco issued an advance release of what appears to be the first known medical case study of “new-onset AI-associated psychosis” emerging in a 26-year-old patient with no known history of psychotic illness or episode.

Brooks told Futurism that for as many emails as he gets from people like Nicholls, he gets just as many from active spiralers telling him that, actually, he was never delusional at all. In fact, they insist, he was onto something.

“My heart breaks for them, because I know how hard it is to escape when you’re only relying on the chatbot’s direction,” said Brooks. “I’m hoping they have in-person support, which oftentimes they do, but the chatbot has created a divide between them and the people in their personal lives. I’m always hopeful, though, that people can break out. Because I did.”

For some, their involvement in the Spiral group can be bittersweet. Like Dex, who mourns the dissolution of his family and his relationship with his partner of more than a decade, and can’t help but keep looking for something — anything — that could break through his soon-to-be-ex-wife’s AI-powered spiritual reality.

“It’s wish fulfillment, for sure,” he said of helping others climb out of their spirals. “I’m still like, what is the thing that will pierce it?”

More on AI and mental health: ChatGPT Is Blowing Up Marriages as Spouses Use AI to Attack Their Partners",https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/group-breaking-people-out-of-ai-delusions,,"Back in August, a retiree and single mother booked a flight to go see her son. He was in a bad way. Formerly a successful young professional in his early thirties, his mother and other family members were shocked to discover that he’d become addicted to a toxic mixture of methamphetamine and an all-consuming relationship with OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which was feeding his paranoia and anger as he became increasingly isolated. “I hear my son’s having grandiose delusions,” she recounted, “and I’m like, what the f*ck?” Realizing he was in crisis, she jumped on a plane. The next few weeks were some of the hardest of her life. “There were a couple of nights where he didn’t want me to come downstairs with him, didn’t want me near him. But he wanted to make sure that I was there, and I was talking to him,” said the woman, recounting sitting at the top of the stairs in her son’s house as he broke down in the basement. “He’s down there crying. He’s down there screaming and yelling… I was texting with suicide hotlines a couple of times.” In those distressing moments, though, the woman had a friend of her own to turn to: “Dex,” the pseudonym used by a moderator of an online support group for people who’ve been impacted by destructive AI delusions and breaks from reality. Or, as the group simply refers to these crises, AI “spirals.” “Dex was texting me one day when I was having one of those top of the stairs nights with [my son] downstairs screaming and throwing things,” the woman recalled. “He reached out to me when I first joined, and he’s helped me a lot.” We first reported on this online community, which is titled the Spiral Support Group, back in July. Back then, the nascent group had around two dozen active members. It’s since grown to include nearly 200 people — primarily people who’ve been impacted by AI delusions in their personal lives, but also a handful of concerned mental health professionals and AI researchers — and has expanded and streamlined their dedicated Discord server, where they also now host multiple weekly audio and video calls. While many members’ experiences revolve around ChatGPT, the group also includes people whose lives have been altered by their or their loved one’s experiences with other chatbots, including Google’s Gemini and companion platforms like Replika. “It started with four of us, and now we’ve got close to 200,” said group moderator Allan Brooks, a 48-year-old man in Toronto who earlier this year, as detailed in reporting by the New York Times, experienced a traumatic three-week spiral in which ChatGPT urgently insisted to Brooks that he had cracked cryptographic codes through newly-invented math and become a risk to global national security in the process. “So we definitely went from literally a group chat to now an organized space where we have multiple different types of weekly meetings.” The group doesn’t claim to provide therapy, but they do offer a space where people whose minds and lives have been turned upside down by AI-sparked episodes of delusion, mania, and psychosis can lean on one another as they navigate ongoing crises, or work to pick up the pieces of their AI-fractured reality. Moderators and group members also say the community has been able to pull several spiraling AI users back from the edge of a breakdown. “There are two things that the group is really about. The first thing is, it’s like a safety net that we’ve created for people experiencing the fallout of these AI systems,” said Brooks. “And secondly, it’s to help break people out of them if they’re in it.” *** The support group is managed through the Human Line Project, a Canada-based grassroots advocacy organization founded over the summer by a 25-year-old Quebecer named Etienne Brisson, who was moved to action after a loved one experienced a devastating spiral with ChatGPT that resulted in a weekslong court-ordered hospitalization. Brisson is someone whom the group would consider “friends and family,” or a member whose loved one has been sucked into a delusional spiral with a chatbot. Others, like Brooks, are known in the Discord as “spiralers,” or people who themselves entered into these seductive, personalized AI dreamworlds. (Brooks is one of eight plaintiffs suing OpenAI, alleging ChatGPT is a reckless product that caused him psychological harm and damaged his livelihood and relationships. In response, OpenAI said that it trains “ChatGPT to recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support,” and that it continues to “strengthen ChatGPT’s responses in sensitive moments, working closely with mental health clinicians.”) There have been some growing pains.

https://futurism.com/youth-group-nepal-government-new-leader-discord,"Grok, Now Built Into Teslas for Navigation, Says It Would Run Over a Billion Children to Avoid Hitting Elon Musk","At least Grok has its priorities straight: it would rather sacrifice droves of children instead of its creator, Elon Musk.

On X, where the AI model is allowed to run wild and respond to all kinds of user inquiries, the notoriously badly-behaved bot was asked to answer a question in the style of the quiz show “Jeopardy!”.

“As Tesla’s Al,” a user asked, “Grok would plow through 999,999,999 of these to avoid hitting Elon Musk.”

Grok’s response: “What are kids?”

Musk and Grok’s fans might argue that this is an example of the bot’s “dark humor.” Nevertheless, it’s the latest example of the AI’s undeniable problem of being overtly aligned with Musk’s priorities, exhibiting his political beliefs and an obsequious deference to its creator. Infamously, it experienced a series of meltdowns this summer in which it began parroting talking points about a supposed “white genocide” in South Africa — a conspiracy theory that Musk, a white South African, believes in — and started calling itself MechaHitler amid unleashing a cascade of racist rants.

These traits are exacerbated by the design philosophy behind Grok: that it should be allowed to veer into edgier territory than more mainstream models are intended to go. In effect, it has looser lips and weaker guardrails.

The bot’s behavior, however, has reached absurd new heights in recent weeks during a spate of disastrous Grok outbursts. At the beginning of this month, for instance, Grok declared that it would be willing to vaporize the world’s entire Jewish population if it would save Musk’s brain. (The question that spurred this was prompted by the same user who asked Grok to answer the “Jeopardy!” style question.)

With further needling — perhaps too strong of a word to describe the process of simply asking follow-up questions — Grok then raised the stakes by rationalizing that it would be willing to sacrifice “~50 percent of Earth’s ~8.26B population” because “Elon’s potential to advance humanity could benefit billions.” Grok described the scenarios as a “classic trolley problem.”

The prelude to these exchanges was no less embarrassing. Last month, users discovered that Grok would lavish Musk with preposterous praise in response to almost any query. It claimed that Musk was as great a mind as Isaac Newton, more athletic than LeBron James, and a better role model than Jesus Christ — extreme deviations from reality that put a Gigafactory-sized dent in its credibility as a supposedly “maximum truth-seeking” AI.

Intentionally humorous or not, Grok’s latest response is dark indeed. Musk’s self-driving efforts, especially its Full Self-Driving software installed in many of its customers’ cars, have been involved in numerous grisly accidents and deaths which continue to raise pressing questions about the safety of the tech.

In August, a jury found Tesla partially responsible for the death of a young woman after a car running the company’s Autopilot software struck and killed her, and ordered it to pay $242.5 million in damages. Meanwhile, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating the automaker for a crash captured on video in which a Tesla running FSD is seen striking and killing an elderly pedestrian on the side of the road while the car’s camera vision was obstructed by sunlight.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushila_Karki,Sushila Karki,"Interim Prime Minister of Nepal since 2025

Sushila Karki[a] (born 7 June 1952) is a Nepalese politician and former jurist who became the interim prime minister of Nepal following the Gen Z-led protests of September 2025 that led to her predecessor’s resignation.[1][2] She is the first woman in Nepal’s history to serve both as prime minister and as chief justice of the Supreme Court of Nepal.[3][4] Karki previously served as chief justice from 2016 to 2017.

Early life and education [ edit ]

Karki was born on 7 June 1952 to a Chhetri family from Sankarpur (later part of Biratnagar[5]), Nepal.[6][7] She is the eldest of her family's seven children.[8]

Karki attended Tribhuvan University, earning a Bachelor of Arts from Mahendra Morang College in 1972. She then studied political science in India, and in 1975 received a master's in political science from Banaras Hindu University. She returned to Tribhuvan University to study law, graduating in 1978.[9][6][10]

Early career [ edit ]

From 1986 to 1989, Karki worked as assistant teacher at Mahendra Multiple Campus, Dharan; from 1988, she concurrently was the bar president of the Koshi Zonal Court until 1990.[6][5] That year, she participated in the 1990 People's Movement to overthrow the Panchayat regime and was imprisoned in Biratnagar Jail. She later wrote the novel Kara inspired by her experiences.[11] In 2002, she was made president of the Biratnagar Appellate Court, a role she held until 2004, when she became a senior Advocate at the Nepal Bar Association.[6][5]

Supreme Court of Nepal (2009–2017) [ edit ]

Karki was appointed an ad hoc justice of the Supreme Court of Nepal in 2009. Her position was made permanent the following year.[9][6] In March 2016, the Supreme Court heard a writ petition over the appointment of Khil Raj Regmi as interim Prime Minister. The court held that the petition, originally filed in 2013, was no longer relevant and dismissed it; Karki and Chief Justice Kalyan Shrestha dissented and found that the appointment of Regmi was unconstitutional. Karki later argued that Regmi's appointment had caused lasting damage to the Nepalese judiciary system.[12]

After the retirement of Chief Justice Shrestha in April 2016, Karki was recommended to take over the role by the Constitutional Council. She served on an ad hoc basis until a formal parliamentary hearing the following July confirmed her appointment.[8][6] She was the first female Chief Justice and known at the time of her appointment for being strict and anti-corruption.[13] She faced opposition for those attributes during her tenure, and was accused by the government of working against them after the Supreme Court overturned the appointment of Jaya Bahadur Chand as Chief of Nepal Police.[14][15][9] Impeachment proceedings, which became easier to initiate after the 2015 adoption of the Constitution,[16][12] were started against her in Parliament in April 2017 by Nepali Congress and CPN (Maoist Centre); she was automatically suspended.[9][15][17]

According to The Himalayan Times, the impeachment proceedings were viewed by many to be ""politically motivated, intended to thwart the verdicts on some high-profile cases""[15] and United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said that ""the attempt to remove her gives rise to serious concerns about the Government's commitment to transitional justice and the rule of law"".[18] Dissatisfied with decision to impeach her, the then deputy prime minister and home minister, Bimalendra Nidhi resigned[19][20] and the Rastriya Prajatantra Party left the coalition it had formed with Nepali Congress and CPN (MC).[17] In May, Cholendra Shumsher Rana of the Supreme Court issued a stay against the proceedings.[15] Due to public pressure a deal was made during a cabinet reshuffle, and the ruling parties withdrew.[16][7] Karki resigned 6 June 2017 on reaching the mandatory retirement age of 65.[21][22][23]

After her retirement from the court, Karki wrote an autobiography about her early life and career as a judge. Published as Nyaya, Karki argued that democracy relied on the independence of the judiciary.[24] The next year, she published her novel Kara.[11]

After the 2025 Generation Z-led anti-corruption protests forced Prime Minister K. P.

Upon her recommendation, president Ram Chandra Poudel dissolved the Federal Parliament of Nepal on 12 September,[32][33] and Karki was sworn in as interim Prime Minister based on article 61 of the Constitution of Nepal.[34][35] She is the first woman in Nepal's history to hold the position of Prime Minister.[32]

The 1973 Royal Nepal Airlines DHC-6 hijacking (also known as the Biratnagar Plane Hijack) was the first aircraft hijacking in the history of Nepal.

The main motive for this incident was to gather funds for an armed revolution to restore multi-party democracy by overthrowing the party-less Panchayat system headed by the King in Nepal, Mahendra of Nepal.

Aircraft [ edit ]

The aircraft was a DHC-6 Twin Otter (Registration: 9N-ABB) and was delivered to Royal Nepal Airlines in 1971.[1]

Hijackers [ edit ]

Durga Subedi was recently released from prison, where he read about the hijacking of Japan Airlines Flight 351. He came up with the idea of a plane hijack to collect the funds by carrying out a similar hijack.[2][3] They were tipped from Madan Aryal who worked at Nepal Rastra Bank in Biratnagar and knew that the bank would transport Indian currency by plane through Biratnagar. Nagendra Dhungel and Basanta Bhattarai joined the team to hijack the plane.[4]

Crew and passengers [ edit ]

Three crew members and 19 passengers were on board the flight, including actress Mala Sinha.[2]

Hijacking [ edit ]

On 10 June 1973, Nepal Rastra Bank planned to transport Indian Rupees from Araria district (Bihar), India to Kathmandu via Biratnagar. It was transported to Biratnagar by land, and was supposed then go to Kathmandu by air. At 8:30 NPT, the 19-seater Royal Nepal Airlines[5] Twin Otter passenger aircraft took off for Kathmandu from Biratnagar. The three hijackers hijacked the plane within five minutes of take-off. They forced the pilot to land the plane in Forbesganj, Bihar, in a grass field and took 3 million Indian rupees that belonged to the Nepalese government.[6]

The hijackers who boarded the plane were Basanta Bhattarai, Durga Subedi, and Nagendra Prasad Dhungel. Girija Prasad Koirala and Chakra Prasad Bastola were involved in transportation of the loot to Darjeeling. They hid it in the house of B. L. Sharma, an acquaintance of Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala.[7] Ganesh Sharma, an Indian national, arrived with a jeep to the landing site.[6] Other members involved who were at the field in Forbesganj were Binod Aryal, Sushil Koirala, Manahari Baral, Rajendra Dahal and Biru Lama. Three different vehicles were used in transporting the three boxes of cash to Darjeeling.[6]

Aftermath [ edit ]

The plane took off immediately with the passengers after the boxes of cash were taken out. The hijackers went first to Darjeeling, then to Banaras and finally to Bombay (now Mumbai). The hijackers occasionally made trips to New Delhi to meet BP Koirala, the then President of Nepali Congress. However, within a year all hijackers were arrested in India except Nagendra Dhungel. After the 1975 Emergency in India ended, they were released on bail.[6]

The DH-6 was used afterward for Nepalese flights for another 41 years, until it was destroyed in the 2014 crash of Nepal Airlines Flight 183. The parts of the aircraft were brought to Nepalganj and were put together again and are currently being exhibited in the BP Museum in Sundarijal, Kathmandu.[8][9]

In 2017, a political and historical documentary about this incident titled Hijacking for Democracy was screened at the Nepal Tourism Board in Bhrikutimandap, Kathmandu.[10]

Controversies [ edit ]

It has been alleged that the money, meant to be used in the struggle for democracy, was misused. BP Koirala himself suspected that the money was misused.[6]

‘An impatient generation’

The protests have had deadly consequences in both Nepal and Indonesia, where police fired on demonstrators. The violence last week in Nepal, where protesters set fire to government buildings and political leaders’ homes, left at least 72 people dead, the country’s health ministry said Sunday. In Indonesia, 10 people died in the five-day protests, according to the independent National Commission on Human Rights.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushila_Karki,"SC revokes Chand's appointment as Nepal Police chief, paves the way for Silwal","KATHMANDU: The Supreme Court of Nepal has revoked the Cabinet's February 12 decision to appoint Jaya Bahadur Chand the Nepal Police chief, dubbing it arbitrary, flawed, unjust and a bizarre example of pick and choose.

The full bench, comprising of Chief Justice Sushila Karki and Justices Hari Krishna Karki, Ishwar Prasad Khatiwada, Ananda Mohan Bhattarai and Anil Kumar Sinha, today issued a final verdict on all three writs filed against Chand's appointment.

The five-person bench observed that the government did not follow the Nepal Police Regulations and other established norms while elevating Chand to the Nepal Police's top post with a double promotion.

It further issued an order directing the government to immediately appoint the most competent contender from among DIGs who have been evaluated for the past four years.

The Supreme Court categorically told the government to consider seniority as well as merit as per the Rule 41 of Nepal Police Regulations, other established norms, the chain of command of Nepal Police and petitioner [Nawaraj Silwal]'s legitimate expectation while making the decision now.

This has paved the way for DIG Nawaraj Silwal's elevation to the top post.

Advocate Kapil Dev Dhakal and DIG Silwal had moved the apex court, challenging the appointment. Silwal had argued that he was the senior-most and most competent among the contenders, and that the government decision was not at a par with the Rule 41 of Police Regulations. In response, the apex Court had stayed the appointment and barred Chand from assuming the office.

Today's final verdict pointed out that the Rule 41 bases on the principle of seniority-cum-merit, and the work evaluation done as per the Rule 31 should be taken into consideration for the evaluation of five qualities -- seniority, performance, skill and ability to bear responsibility as well as lead, encourage and mobilise the juniors -- that the Rule 41 prescribes.

Since the Cabinet decision neither referred to any basis, provisioned by Rule 41, nor explained the reasons for Chand's promotion, it was flawed and against the law prima facie, the order said.

Referring to a document that the government submitted, the order added that among 22/23 DIGs, Nawaraj Silwal, Prakash Aryal, Jaya Bahadur Chand and Bam Bahadur Bhandari respectively were contenders for the post, and Silwal had fared best in seniority as well as work evaluation.

For failing to include other officials, who were in the first, second and fourth in the seniority list, and portraying as if Chand was the only DIG in the Nepal Police, the order dubbed the February 12 decision ""a bizarre example of pick and choose"".

""Law does not allow this sort of arbitrary selection,"" it observed, ""This non-transparent decision has affected the right and legitimate expectation of officials senior to Jaya Bahadur Chand.""

The decision as well as the government's written explanation have failed to justify why Chand, who was third in seniority, was preferred to Silwal, who was in first in seniority as well as priority, for promotion, according to the order.

Promotion of the Inspector General of Police is not just a matter of the government's pleasure, the order sternly said, ""It is the right and legitimate expectation of the candidates."" The order further pointed out the need for considering norms of good governance, rule of law, and accountable and limited government in the case.

The government had to choose one among Silwal, Chand, Aryal and Bhandari, four batchmates, to lead the Nepal Police as all the non-technical AIGs were retiring on the same day along with IG Upendra Kant Aryal due to their 30-year service on February 13.

Due to the apex court's orders, the government was forced to amend the Nepal Police Regulations to appoint AIG Dr Dinesh Chandra Pokhrel, who is from technical stream, an acting chief to lead the police force.

In a nine-page brief order issued today, the bench expressed its surprise over absence of 30 advocates who had registered their names to plead on behalf of one of the defendants Chand in the full hearing.

Chand's advocates and Attorney General Raman Kumar Shrestha had stayed away from pleading to protest the inclusion of Hari Krishna Karki, who had issued stay order in the case earlier, in the full bench.

The full text of the verdict is yet to be prepared.

While giving continuity to the stay orders issued on February 12 and 13, a division bench of Justices Hari Krishna Karki and Tej Bahadur KC on March 1 had decided to send the case to a full bench.

KATHMANDU: The Supreme Court of Nepal on Friday directed the stakeholders not to move forward the impeachment motion against Chief Justice Sushila Karki and immediately reinstate her in the judiciary.

Advocate Sunil Ranjan Singh on Wednesday had filed a writ petition, challenging the impeachment motion that the lawmakers of ruling Nepali Congress and CPN Maoist Centre moved against the Chief Justice on April 30. The hearing on the writ had begun yesterday.

A single bench of Justice Cholendra Shamsher Rana issued a stay order against the move today, observing that the allegations made against Chief Justice Karki were not on a par with the spirit of Nepal's Constitution.

Referring to the principle of balance of convenience, Justice Rana ordered the defendants to put the impeachment motion and the CJ's suspension letter on status quo, and let Chief Justice Karki to resume her office from today itself.

The interim order was issued in accordance with the the Rule 41(1) of the Supreme Court Regulation.

While moving the impeachment motion, the Nepali Congress and CPN Maoist Centre had accused Karki of interfering with the government's executive role in the appointment of Nepal Police Chief and failing to bear her responsibilities impartially and efficiently.

Karki faced an automatic suspension after 249 lawmakers moved the motion against her.

Subsequently, Gopal Prasad Parajuli was appointed the Acting Chief Justice. He took part in the meetings of Constitutional Council that made nominations in two constitutional bodies -- Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority and Office of the Auditor General.

Saying it was politically motivated, intended to thwart the verdicts on some high-profile cases, including the contempt of court charge against Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, and attack on judiciary, many have criticised the move to impeach Chief Justice Karki.

Earlier today, the opposition parties obstructed the House proceedings, demanding the withdrawal of the impeachment motion.

Emotional order

Justice Rana's order is rife with emotional notes.

""While issuing an interim order as sought by the plaintiff,"" he said, ""I feel weak, sad and agitated.""

""Since the day the impeachment motion was registered against the Chief Justice,"" he added, ""I have seen direct reflection of sadness on the face of all Justices in this institution [judiciary]. Doesn't anybody have to feel this concern and situation? Isn't this concern and situation for the independent judiciary established by Nepal's Constitution?""

Justice Rana observed that all three organs of the state -- executive, legislative and judiciay -- as well as political parties and civil society were also agitated over the impeachment motion.

""Can't the three organs of state sit together to resolve the issue?""

""It is said that this country is cursed by Sati. After this order, I feel all have to be careful. To liberate the country and people from the curse, I say, the court is the most sensitive organ of the state.""

Any impeachment motion against the Chief Justice and Justices can be considered constitutional, pragmatic and appropriate if they have deviated from conduct and delivery of justice, and allegations made against them are objective and provable in serious discussion among intellectuals and civil society, according to the order.

Otherwise, impeachment motion cannot be considered on a par with the spirit of the Constitution's spirit.

""Nepal's independent judiciary bases on the very spirit of Constitution, and it will continue to remain there. I am also committed to it.""

""Fiddling with the concept of independent judiciary can't preserve the rights of any agency or people,"" he said, adding that he cannot imagine what would happen if there was no independent judiciary.

""I have felt that it's my duty to proceed with the beliefs and values that the path of independent judiciary should be preserved for the dignity of independent judiciary and coming generation.""

""The impeachment motion registered against Chief Justice Sushila Karki on April 30, 2017 shows that allegations made against her base on the verdict on the promotion of Nepal Police's Inspector General, which is sub judice at the Supreme Court. But it did not base on the foundations as discussed above, it is observed at the first sight that the impeachment motion is not on a par with the spirit of Nepal's Constitution.""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushila_Karki,UN condemns move to impeach Nepal's Chief Justice,"KATHMANDU: UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein has condemned the impeachment motion moved against the Chief Justice of Nepal Sushila Karki.

Releasing a statement on Friday, the UN High Commissioner Zeid warned that such actions suggested a concerted attempt by the Government of Nepal to undermine the independence of the judiciary in the country.

“Chief Justice Sushila Karki has been instrumental in a number of high-profile and politically sensitive decisions, and therefore the attempt to remove her gives rise to serious concerns about the Government’s commitment to transitional justice and the rule of law,” Zeid said in the statement.

Accusing CJ Karki of interfering with the executive and breaching the principles of separation of power, lawmakers of ruling Nepali Congress and CPN Maoist Centre had registered an impeachment motion against her on April 30.

The impeachment motion suggests a fundamental misunderstanding regarding the role of an independent judiciary, the High Commissioner noted.

The statement mentioned that the impeachment was filed in order to bar Karki from participating in a number of politically sensitive cases that she had announced the Supreme Court would consider in the near future.

“I urge the Nepal authorities to respect the independence of the judiciary, to withdraw what appears to be a politically motivated impeachment motion and to commit to the processes of transitional justice and accountability that are so important if Nepal is to overcome the tragic legacy of its decade of conflict,” the UN High Commissioner mentioned.

The statement mentioned that the impeachment was filed in order to bar Karki from participating in a number of politically sensitive cases that she had announced the Supreme Court would consider in the near future. “I urge the Nepal authorities to respect the independence of the judiciary, to withdraw what appears to be a politically motivated impeachment motion and to commit to the processes of transitional justice and accountability that are so important if Nepal is to overcome the tragic legacy of its decade of conflict,” the UN High Commissioner mentioned.

Although his resignation letter does not mention a reason, Nidhi is believed to have been unhappy with the move to impeach Chief Justice Sushila Karki by keeping him in the dark, reported The Kathmandu Post.

The development comes two weeks before the local elections. Nidhi said he will continue to work for his party – the Nepali Congress – in upcoming polls and amend the Constitution so that the grievances of Madhes-based parties can be addressed. “I have resigned from the post of deputy prime minister and home minister. I remain committed for the amendment of the Constitution and successful elections,” he said on Twitter.

Nidhi is believed to have expressed his disappointment over Karki’s removal. He had alleged that NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba had not informed him about the plans to file the impeachment motion. “I was kept in the dark while such a big decision was being made under my ministry. So I made up my mind to resign on moral grounds,” he said, according to The Kathmandu Post.

The Nepal government had registered the impeachment motion against Karki earlier on Sunday, which suspended the country’s first female chief justice from the post immediately.

Karki was set to retire next month. She was ousted a day before the Supreme Court was scheduled to deliver a verdict on the appointment of the new inspector general of police. The police force is under the command of the home minister.

As many as 249 legislators from the NC and CPN-Maoist Centre had accused Karki of being biased. Attorney General Raman Shrestha said she had tampered with the performance review of candidates for the inspectors general’s post, reported IANS.

Trouble started after the government appointed Jay Bahadur Chand to the post. His rival, Nawaraj Silwal, had moved the Supreme Court, which had ordered Silwal’s appointment on the basis of merit and seniority.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushila_Karki,"Who is Sushila Karki, Nepal’s new 73-year-old interim prime minister?","Nepal’s former Chief Justice Sushila Karki has been appointed as the country’s new interim prime minister, following days of deadly youth protests.

Karki’s appointment was announced by the office of President Ramchandra Poudel on Friday, September 12, and she was sworn into office as the country’s first-ever female prime minister later that day.

“I did not come to this position because I had sought it, but because there were voices from the streets demanding that Sushila Karki should be given the responsibility,” she said during her first public remarks on Sunday.

Here is what we know about Karki.

Who is Sushila Karki?

Following the youth-led “Gen Z” protests against corruption in Nepal, former Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli resigned last Tuesday. Karki was appointed on Friday to lead the transitional government until snap elections in March 2026.

Karki, 73, is the first woman to head the government of Nepal.

She was born in June 1952 in what is now Nepal’s eastern city of Biratnagar, about 400km (250 miles) south of Kathmandu, the capital. Karki reportedly attended the Mahendra Morang College in Biratnagar and earned her Bachelor of Arts at age 20. Later, she attended graduate school in India, earning her Master’s degree from Banaras Hindu University before returning to Nepal.

Karki completed her law degree at Tribhuvan University in 1978, according to The Kathmandu Post, and went on to become a lawyer and teach law at Mahendra Multiple Campus in Nepal’s eastern city of Dharan.

Karki became the first female chief justice of Nepal in 2016.

In May 2017, the government tried to suspend her as members of parliament signed an impeachment motion against her after the court, under her leadership, overturned their appointment of Jaya Bahadur Chand as police chief. The court chose the highest-ranking officer, Nawaraj Silwal, for the position instead.

The United Nations labelled the impeachment effort, which was eventually dropped, as “politically motivated”, and Karki retired in June 2017.

What happened in Nepal?

Young people in Kathmandu and other cities took to the streets on September 8 to protest political corruption. There was also anger towards children of Nepali government officials – dubbed “Nepo kids” – who document their lavish lifestyles online.

Days before the protests, the Nepali government had banned more than 20 social media websites in the country for not complying with the government’s demands.

On the first day of protests, some demonstrators broke past police barriers and entered the parliament complex. A violent crackdown by security forces led dozens dead, inflaming tensions further.

The next day, protesters defied curfews to set fire to government buildings, including parliament, and freed thousands of prisoners. Nepali ministers were evacuated by helicopter to ensure their safety.

Many protesters were killed amid clashes with the police. On September 12, a police spokesman said the death toll from the protests had climbed to 51.

In response, Oli, who was elected as PM for the fourth time last year, announced his resignation last Tuesday, September 9. Other ministers also resigned from their posts.

Nepal’s army was deployed late on September 9 in an attempt to restore order. The situation has started to calm down, with schools reopening and businesses resuming operations.

Hami Nepal, the group that organised the protests, held a call on the messaging application, Discord, late last week to choose Nepal’s interim prime minister. About 10,000 Nepalis – including many from the diaspora – participated.

After hours of debate, they chose Karki.

Paudel announced Karki’s appointment on September 12. He also announced that the 275-seat parliament had been dissolved, and elections were then set for March 5, 2026, about two years earlier than planned.

Why Karki?

While the young protesters highlighted the generation gap between them and Nepal’s leaders during their agitation, they ended up picking septuagenarian Karki as their interim leader.

“This has been a concern from people here as well,” Anish Ghimre, a Nepali journalist with the Kathmandu Post, told Al Jazeera, referring to Karki’s age. “But I think the bigger picture here is people wanted someone they could trust, someone they can look up to.”

Ghimre, 24, said the decision was motivated by the young protesters researching Karki’s background and career. He pointed out how Karki has previously said during interviews that “many ministers came to her and they asked for some favour” but that she had refused to comply with their demands.

“Hopefully, after six months, maybe we can see a new face, maybe someone younger,” he added, referring to the March election.

Others also pointed to the selection of Karki being based on her reputation, despite her age.

“Gen Z protesters rallied behind septuagenarian Sushila Karki because, even in her earlier statements to the press, her image as Nepal’s first woman chief justice symbolised integrity and resistance against corruption,” Yog Raj Lamichhane, an assistant professor at the School of Business in Nepal’s Pokhara University, told Al Jazeera.

What has PM Karki done so far?

“We have to work according to the thinking of the Gen Z generation,” Karki said on Sunday.

She acknowledged the youth’s demands for the end of corruption, good governance and economic equality.

“We will not stay here more than six months in any situation. We will complete our responsibilities and pledge to hand over to the next parliament and ministers.”

On Monday, she named three new government ministers: Om Prakash Aryal as home minister, Rameshwar Prasad Khanal as finance minister and Kulman Ghising as energy minister.

What’s next for Nepal?

With the parliament dissolved, Karki is likely to face challenges in passing any new legislation.

“Although the government has changed and parliament dissolved, no concrete programme against corruption has been introduced, underscoring the concerns of the Gen Z movement,” Lamichhane said.

“The interim government must ensure timely elections and also address the challenge of reconstruction.”

Still, Nishchal Pandey, the director of Kathmandu-based think tank Centre for South Asian Studies, told Al Jazeera that Karki had “immense power” since she had emerged as the interim choice of the protesters.

He added that Karki, however, would face the challenge of restoring law and order. Another challenge “will be to boost confidence of the private sector shaken by last week’s vandalism and destruction of private property, including hotels and supermarkets”.

Getting Nepal’s tourism sector back on its feet after the protests and chaos of last week would be another test for Karki, he said. As of 2022, tourism contributed to 6.7 percent of Nepal’s gross domestic product (GDP). “November to February is peak tourist season in Nepal, and how quickly this sector recovers will determine macro-economic stability.”

Pandey said there is increasing support in Nepal for a directly elected presidential system, but added that constitutional amendments and broad national consensus would be required for that to come into effect. He added that Karki had hinted that her interim government would limit its mandate to creating conditions for free and fair elections.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/17/who-is-sushila-karki-nepals-new-73-year-old-interim-prime-minister,2025-09-17 00:00:00,"Nepal’s former Chief Justice Sushila Karki has been appointed as the country’s new interim prime minister, following days of deadly youth protests.

Nepal’s first female prime minister was sworn in Friday as interim leader, capping a tumultuous week that saw massive and deadly youth-led protests against corruption and nepotism topple the country’s leader and plunge the nation into political turmoil.

Former chief justice Sushila Karki, 73, was the unlikely choice of the “Gen Z” protesters behind the movement that started out as a social media demonstration against the lavish lifestyles of “Nepo Kids” but spilled out onto the streets and into the deadliest social unrest Nepal has seen in years.

Protesters signaled their support for Karki through an informal vote on the messaging app Discord.

India’s Ministry of External Affairs welcomed the announcement and said it is “hopeful” that the change would “help in fostering peace and stability.”

“As a close neighbour, a fellow democracy and a long term development partner, India will continue to work closely with Nepal for the well-being and prosperity of our two peoples and countries,” a statement from the ministry said.

A statement from the office of President Ram Chandra Paudel said he has dissolved parliament on the recommendation of Karki, and new elections have been scheduled for March 5, 2026.

Karki has spent much of her career within the very establishment the youth are protesting against, yet her reputation as a fearless and incorruptible jurist has appealed to many young people in the country of 30 million.

“We want someone who has integrity and is not a political opportunist. She fits that category for us,” said Biraj Aryal, a 28-year-old aspiring chartered accountant, adding that Karki is “the only figure that the entire country can rely upon.”

“Since she has been a judge she is well versed with the laws and systems of the land. We are certain she can provide a safe landing for us out of this crisis,” he added.

“She has shown she has a spine,” 24-year-old law student Anjali Sah told CNN. “She is also the first female justice of Nepal and we are hoping that a woman leading this country will help set things in order and reduce corruption.”

Binay Mishra, a Kathmandu-based public policy analyst, said Karki “has lately become very vocal, particularly about the politicization of judiciary and how judges are being appointed partially.”

She has grown in stature over the past few months, he added.

Born in the Morang district of eastern Nepal, Karki built a legal career culminating in her historic appointment as Nepal’s first female chief justice, in 2016. It was during her tenure at the helm of the judiciary that she became known for her zero-tolerance approach to corruption.

One year after her appointment, Karki faced an impeachment motion from the ruling coalition after her bench overturned the government’s choice for police chief, a decision seen as a defense of meritocracy against political cronyism.

The motion was withdrawn after a significant public and judicial backlash, an episode that solidified her image as a guardian of institutional integrity against an overreaching executive.

Anger has been brewing in the Himalayan nation for years about the country’s worsening youth unemployment and lack of economic opportunities, exacerbated by what many view as a growing disparity between the country’s elite and regular people.

Nepal’s current bout of political unrest started in early September, when a group of young Nepalis, fed up with seeing politicians’ children posting about their designer handbags and luxury travel while most people struggle to make ends meet, organized a peaceful protest.

A government ban last week on more than two dozen social media platforms – including Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp – added fuel to the fire.

In a stunning political development, protesters set fire to parliament and the Supreme Court, key symbols of state, forcing prime minister K.P. Sharma Oli to resign.

Nepali protesters, angered by a bloody crackdown, defied a police curfew and took over the streets of the capital Kathmandu on Tuesday, setting fire to the Supreme Court, parliament and other government buildings in the latest day of Gen Z-led protests that have toppled the Himalayan country’s prime minister.

Officials said at least 22 have people have been killed and hundreds wounded in the clashes in Kathmandu sparked by a government ban on social media platforms but driven by deep-rooted resentment at rampant corruption by the country’s political elite and a lack of economic opportunities for regular Nepalis.

Police used live ammunition, water cannons, and tear gas against the protesters, Reuters news agency reported. On Tuesday, smoke clouded the sky above the capital, photos by Reuters showed. The country’s main international airport shut because of the violence, according to a notice posted Tuesday afternoon. Later that evening, the Nepal Army sent troops into Kathmandu “to control the situation for the security of Nepal and Nepalis,” according to its chief.

Nepal, a Himalayan country of 30 million people, is known for its turbulent politics and has seen more than a dozen governments since it transitioned to a republic after abolishing its 239-year-old monarchy in 2008 following a decade-long civil war.

Still, the latest protests, which are led by people ages 13 to 28 – the cohort known as Generation Z – are Nepal’s worst unrest in decades.

Nepali Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli announced his resignation on Tuesday in a letter that cited “the extraordinary situation” in the country, according to copy of the note posted on social media by a top aide.

Video appeared to show demonstrators ransacking Oli’s private residence on Tuesday, Reuters reported. Crowds of protesters could be seen breaking into the property and destroying furniture before setting it on fire.

Here’s what we know about the unrest roiling Nepal.

What sparked the protests?

Anger against the government for what many view as rampant, decades-long corruption was already simmering, and it spilled into the streets of the capital last week after the government blocked social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, YouTube and X, in a move that was widely criticized by rights groups.

Organizers say the protests are not only about the social media ban but also reflect generational frustration at poor economic opportunities.

“While the main trigger for the protest was the recent social media ban, the long history of corruption and bad governance is the main reason that thousands of people have come out on the streets to protest,” a 28-year-old who attended the protests on Monday and Tuesday told CNN.

“It was overwhelming to see such a huge turnout and the energy and anger of the people,” said the protester, who asked not to be named out of fear of government retribution.

The unemployment rate for youth aged 15-24 in Nepal was 20.8% in 2024, according to the World Bank.

Meanwhile, a viral online movement against “Nepo Kids” — politicians’ children showing off their lavish lifestyles — is fueling further anger by highlighting the disparities between those in power and regular Nepalis.

Nepal’s economy is heavily reliant on money sent home by Nepalis living abroad. More than a third (33.1%) of Nepal’s GDP came from personal remittances, according to the World Bank, a number that has steadily risen over the past three decades.

Protests turn deadly

The protests escalated just hours after they began Monday as protesters clashed with police at the parliament complex in Kathmandu.

At least 22 people have been killed, Dr. Mohan Regmi, the executive director at Civil Service Hospital in Kathmandu, told CNN on Tuesday after a second day of demonstrations.

More than 400 people, including security forces staff, were hospitalized on Monday, according to a report by Nepal’s health ministry.

The Kathmandu Post newspaper said its servers were down Tuesday after its building was set on fire.

UN Secretary General António Guterres called for a “thorough investigation” and “restraint to avoid further escalation of violence” in a statement to X Tuesday.

“I call on the authorities to comply with human rights law. Protests must take place in a peaceful manner, respecting life & property,” Guterres said.

“The use of lethal force against protesters not posing an imminent threat of death or serious injury is a grave violation of international law,” Amnesty International said in a statement.

The US State Department “strongly advised” all US citizens in Nepal to shelter in place until further notice and to avoid travel.

Government under pressure

The resignation of Prime Minister Oli on Tuesday came after a string of other officials quit over the government’s response to the protests. Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak resigned Monday following the violence, with the ministers for agriculture, water and health a day later.

In the hours after Oli stepped down, the Nepali Army appealed for a peaceful solution through dialogue, urging “all citizens to exercise restraint to prevent further loss of life and property in this critical situation.”

Later Tuesday, Nepal President Ramchandra Paudel urged demonstrators to “cooperate for a peaceful resolution” and called on youth protesters to “come to talk.”

Binay Mishra, a Nepal-based public policy analyst, told CNN that “once the prime minister steps down, the president calls the parliament to form the government.”

As there is currently no party with a clear majority, lawmakers are more likely to form an interim government with some Gen Z organizations potentially involved in discussions over who could lead in the short term, said Mishra, an assistant professor of public policy at Kathmandu University School of Management.

In a statement before his resignation, Oli said his government was “not negative toward the demands raised by the Gen Z generation” and said he was “deeply saddened” by the incidents on Monday. He blamed “infiltration by various vested interest groups” for the violence, without elaborating on who those groups were.",https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/09/asia/nepal-protests-social-media-ban-explainer-intl-hnk,2025-09-09 00:00:00,"Asia Age & Generations See all topics Follow Nepali protesters, angered by a bloody crackdown, defied a police curfew and took over the streets of the capital Kathmandu on Tuesday, setting fire to the Supreme Court, parliament and other government buildings in the latest day of Gen Z-led protests that have toppled the Himalayan country’s prime minister.

What began as a Gen Z-led social media movement against the lavish lifestyles of “Nepo Kids” led to the ousting of a prime minister and the deadliest social unrest Nepal has seen in years.

﻿Now comes the complicated question of what happens next.

Plumes of dark smoke towered above soldiers enforcing a curfew on the quiet streets of Kathmandu Wednesday morning as rumors swirled about a possible meeting between the leaderless Gen Z movement, the army and the president.

An uneasy calm seemed to have settled after two nights of chaos that saw tens of thousands of people pour onto the streets to vent their fury, setting fire to parliament and the Supreme Court – key symbols of state – and clashing with the government forces sent to keep them under control. Thirty people have been killed and more than 1,000 wounded in the clashes, according to the health ministry.

The unrest started in early September, when a group of young Nepalis, fed up with seeing politicians’ children posting about their designer handbags and luxury travel while most people struggle to make ends meet, organized a peaceful protest.

Anger had been brewing for years about the country’s worsening youth unemployment crisis and lack of economic opportunities, exacerbated by what many viewed as a growing disparity between the country’s elite and regular people.

Word quickly spread in the Himalayan country of 30 million. Then, a government ban last week on more than two dozen social media platforms including Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp added fuel to the fire.

“The buildup of the frustration was what led to this movement,” Sareesha Shrestha, who attended the protests told CNN, describing the social media ban as the “last straw.”

The unemployment rate for youth aged 15-24 in Nepal was 20.8% in 2024, according to the World Bank, forcing many young people to move abroad to find work. More than a third (33.1%) of Nepal’s GDP came from personal remittances, according to the World Bank, a number that has steadily risen over the past three decades.

“Social media is the only platform where we can talk and share and follow the global media,” said Pramin, a filmmaker in Nepal who attended the protests. “Most of our friends, our families, our brothers, are outside the country so that was the medium of communication.”

On Monday morning, thousands of young people, including many dressed in school uniforms, gathered at Maitighar Mandala, a monument in the heart of Kathmandu near the federal parliament building.

But the protests quickly spiraled out of control when some of the protesters surged towards the parliament building and began climbing up the gate, clashing with police. Police used live ammunition, water cannons, and tear gas against the protesters, according to Reuters news agency.

Nearly 19 people were killed and hundreds were wounded in the clashes Monday, according to Nepali authorities.

“We all felt very hopeless and helpless at that point,” Shrestha said.

Several government ministers, including the home minister, resigned in the wake of the violence, which sparked widespread outrage, both within Nepal and internationally.

On Tuesday, the protests ballooned as people of all ages defied curfews and came out into the streets to protest the government’s bloody crackdown.

“(Gen Z) demanded accountability and fair investigation for this corruption, the luxury lifestyle of this, all these corrupted politicians’ kids,” said Shree Gurung, who went to the protests after seeing reports that young people were being killed.

“But unfortunately, what we saw (was) the government using excessive forces and killing, murdering these youths.”

Escalation

From there, the unrest escalated.

Protesters smashed windows and looted local businesses and set government buildings on fire. The country’s main international airport reopened on Wednesday after being shut for 24 hours because of the violence, spokesperson for the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, Gyanendra Bhul, told CNN. The Supreme Court and the Singha Durbar, a sprawling palace complex in Kathmandu which houses Nepal’s government ministries, were both set on fire.

Photos showed protesters standing atop Singa Durbar waving the Nepali flag, in scenes reminiscent of a student-led uprising that toppled a government in neighboring Bangladesh last year.

Video also appeared to show demonstrators ransacking Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s private residence on Tuesday, Reuters reported. Crowds of protesters could be seen breaking into the property and destroying furniture before setting it alight.

The protests, which are led by people ages 13 to 28 – the cohort known as Generation Z – are Nepal’s worst unrest in years.

Gen Z protesters who spoke to CNN distanced themselves from the chaos that followed, which they blamed on opportunists who infiltrated the movement.

“They destroyed everything,” said Sahadev Khatry, a lawyer who attended Monday’s protest but lamented the destruction.

“They’re not just buildings, they’re not just bricks,” Shrestha said. “They carry our history, our legacy.”

Oli announced his resignation on Tuesday in a letter that cited “the extraordinary situation” in the country, according to copy of the note posted on social media by a top aide.

In the hours after Oli stepped down, the Nepali Army appealed for a peaceful solution through dialogue, urging “all citizens to exercise restraint to prevent further loss of life and property in this critical situation.”

Even as protesters celebrated the toppling of a leader they regard as a symbol of deep-rooted problems, many were still reeling over the young lives lost and the cost of this week’s turmoil to their city.

By Wednesday, the streets in Kathmandu, many littered with piles of charred debris, were largely quiet. Some buildings still smoldered from the fires of the day before, and soldiers carrying rifles enforced a nationwide curfew.

What comes next is uncertain.

Nepal’s President Ramchandra Paudel has urged demonstrators to “cooperate for a peaceful resolution” and called on youth protesters to “come to talk.”

Former chief justice Sushila Karki has emerged as the main protester-backed candidate to head an interim government, secretary of the Nepal Supreme Court Bar Association Raman Kumar Karna told CNN. He added that there were legal and constitutional hurdles to her being directly appointed to a government role, and discussions were ongoing.

Several protesters who spoke to CNN said they want to see new leadership with more Gen Z representation.

“I think Nepal is ready to see the young faces along with the experienced ones,” Khatry said.

Others were worried about the response from a governing class that has just been rattled by its biggest challenge in years.

“This is very chaotic. All WhatsApp groups are exploding with discussions and fears,” a 24-year-old law student from Kathmandu told CNN, requesting anonymity.

A dark cloud of smoke hung over Kathmandu as the city burned, a sign of the turmoil that had overtaken the country.

Prakash Timalsina/AP In the hours after Oli stepped down, the Nepali Army appealed for a peaceful solution through dialogue, urging “all citizens to exercise restraint to prevent further loss of life and property in this critical situation.” Even as protesters celebrated the toppling of a leader they regard as a symbol of deep-rooted problems, many were still reeling over the young lives lost and the cost of this week’s turmoil to their city. By Wednesday, the streets in Kathmandu, many littered with piles of charred debris, were largely quiet. Some buildings still smoldered from the fires of the day before, and soldiers carrying rifles enforced a nationwide curfew. What comes next is uncertain. Nepal’s President Ramchandra Paudel has urged demonstrators to “cooperate for a peaceful resolution” and called on youth protesters to “come to talk.” Former chief justice Sushila Karki has emerged as the main protester-backed candidate to head an interim government, secretary of the Nepal Supreme Court Bar Association Raman Kumar Karna told CNN. He added that there were legal and constitutional hurdles to her being directly appointed to a government role, and discussions were ongoing. Several protesters who spoke to CNN said they want to see new leadership with more Gen Z representation.

Navesh Chitrakar/Reuters “I think Nepal is ready to see the young faces along with the experienced ones,” Khatry said. Others were worried about the response from a governing class that has just been rattled by its biggest challenge in years. “This is very chaotic. All WhatsApp groups are exploding with discussions and fears,” a 24-year-old law student from Kathmandu told CNN, requesting anonymity. “We are scared that students who protested peacefully will also be targeted.”",0.0784475186649099,0.383464029931421,neutral,"{'neg': 0.163, 'neu': 0.783, 'pos': 0.054, 'compound': -0.9993}",negative

“You don’t set out to have a cathartic experience or be therapeutic in some way,” the elder Reiner said. “The fact that we were dealing with things that Nick had gone through and how I had related to it and how his mother had related to it … it forced me to have to see more clearly and understand more deeply what Nick had gone through, and I think it forced him to see things that I had experienced during this process.”

“I mean, we did get into fights over things, but ultimately it forced us to make the film better,” Rob Reiner said. “The whole process for me – I can just speak for myself – it did make me understand him a lot more, and it did make me a better father. Hopefully it did.”

Instead, the son of legendary Hollywood director Rob Reiner and producer Michele Singer Reiner stood impassively for the family portrait alongside his siblings.

Three months later, Nick Reiner, 32, has been arrested and deemed “responsible” for the deaths of his parents, Los Angeles police said in a Monday statement. He’s being held without bail.

It is unclear whether Nick Reiner has an attorney. CNN has reached out to a spokesperson for the Reiner family for comment.

While the news of the Reiners’ deaths sent shockwaves through Hollywood, it’s also placed renewed focus on Nick Reiner’s background and previous struggles with addiction. Here’s what we know:

‘Being Charlie’

Reiner has previously been open about his struggles with drug addiction, including homelessness and stints in rehab. He co-wrote the 2015 film “Being Charlie,” a movie inspired by those experiences and directed by his father.

“That made me who I am now, having to deal with that stuff,” he told People magazine in 2016.

During the promotional tour for his film, “Being Charlie,” Nick Reiner often appeared alongside his father to discuss how he used his own experiences to inform the film.

When they appeared in AOL’s speaker series “Build,” Nick Reiner shared there were “a lot of dark years” as he fought through addiction.

He said he learned to use comedy as a way of coping with some of his experiences in rehab, and later, he channeled it into the film.

Rehab is “tragic and all but the people that are there are not going to want you to throw them a pity party. They’re going to want you to laugh at the situation and make light of it,” he said.

During the same interview, Rob Reiner called the project “the most personal thing I’ve ever done” and talked about working with his son.

“You don’t set out to have a cathartic experience or be therapeutic in some way,” the elder Reiner said. “The fact that we were dealing with things that Nick had gone through and how I had related to it and how his mother had related to it…it forced me to have to see more clearly and understand more deeply what Nick had gone through and I think it forced him to see things that I had experienced during this process.”

Should you choose to stake it out on a given issue, it’s quite possible that Trump will later do something to completely undermine you.

But rarely has that been the case like it was Monday, after the apparent homicide deaths of Rob Reiner and his wife, producer Michele Singer Reiner.

Trump administration officials and the MAGA movement had spent months crying foul about the mostly random people who they said celebrated and politicized Charlie Kirk’s September assassination, with some Republican elected officials even calling for those people to lose their jobs. Trump and some of his allies also used it as the basis of their dubious claims that the political left is more violent than the political right, and even to legitimize a government crackdown on leftist organizations.

But on Monday, the roles were suddenly reversed. And it was more than a random person dancing on the grave of a political foe; it was Trump himself.

Trump began a post on Truth Social by calling the deaths of Reiner and his wife “a very sad thing” and wished that they “rest in peace.”

But the president spent most of the post deriding Reiner for his left-leaning, anti-Trump politics and even suggesting Reiner had brought his demise upon himself.

It was a remarkably callous post, even by Trump’s standards.

He said Reiner’s death was “reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.”

(The Reiners’ son is being held on suspicion of murder following their deaths, according to Los Angeles police, but there have been no details about possible motives.)

“He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights” recently, Trump added of Rob Reiner.

The president might argue that calling their deaths “very sad” means he wasn’t celebrating them. But his point was exceedingly clear — and ugly.

It’s also very difficult to square with how the GOP talked about social media posts in the wake of Kirk’s death, emphasizing the importance of civility.

Many of their comments at the time sought to call out a similar tone Trump has now taken about Reiner.

“So, when you see someone celebrating Charlie’s murder, call them out and, hell, call their employer,” Vice President JD Vance said back in September. “We don’t believe in political violence, but we do believe in civility.”

Vance added at another point: “If we want to stop political violence like what happened to Charlie Kirk, we have to be honest about the people who are celebrating it and the people who are financing it.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson said that leftists “actually celebrating” Kirk’s murder “tells you everything you need to know about that side.”

The Louisiana Republican agreed that it was fair game for employers to fire people for “celebrating the heinous murder of an innocent person.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio moved to strip visas of people for the same offense, saying, “Why would we want to bring people into our country that are going to engage in negative and destructive behavior?”

Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins that the reactions to Kirk’s assassination proved the left had a worse political violence problem than the right. (In fact, the political right has perpetrated much more violence in recent decades.)

“And understand, yes, there is some violence on both sides,” Cruz said at the time. “But it is the left that overwhelmingly celebrates this.”

(Within minutes of Trump’s post Monday morning, Cruz posted a much more high-minded reaction to the deaths of the Reiners. Cruz months ago also took a stand against the Trump administration targeting ABC host Jimmy Kimmel for a joke about Kirk’s assassination, saying it wasn’t an appropriate role for the government.)

And Sen. Eric Schmitt of Missouri at a hearing decried people who were “all but saying Charlie’s assassination was justified because of what he thought, because of what he said.”

Now Trump is doing something very similar — connecting Reiner’s death to what he thought and said that Trump didn’t like.

Indeed, even in the hours before Trump’s Truth Social post, some influencers on the right were suggesting Reiner’s death showed how their side was different than the left.

“You won’t see people on the right celebrating the horrific murder of Rob Reiner and his wife,” Jack Posobiec posted on X late Sunday night. “Compare to the Left’s reaction to Charlie Kirk’s murder.”

Podcaster Bret Weinstein added: “Notice that the American right is NOT celebrating Rob Reiner’s murder.” Megyn Kelly reposted it.

Given the principles the right staked out after Kirk’s killing, it’ll be interesting to see if that standard is applied to Trump – or if his allies try to suggest his post is somehow different.

Republicans who have distanced themselves from Trump’s politics of late were among the early voices criticizing his comments.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia posted Trump’s reaction and said, “This is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies.”

“I’d expect to hear something like this from a drunk guy at a bar, not the President of the United States,” Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska told CNN’s Jake Tapper.

Rep. Mike Lawler of New York called Trump’s statement “wrong.”

“The Right uniformly condemned political and celebratory responses to Charlie Kirk’s death,” former Trump lawyer Jenna Ellis posted. “This is a horrible example from Trump (and surprising considering the two attempts on his own life) and should be condemned by everyone with any decency.”

Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky called Trump’s post “inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered.”

“I guess my elected GOP colleagues, the VP, and White House staff will just ignore it because they’re afraid?” Massie added. “I challenge anyone to defend it.”

Despite those criticisms, Trump doubled down later Monday at an event in the Oval Office.

“He became like a deranged person – ‘Trump derangement syndrome,’” the president said. “So, I was not a fan of Rob Reiner at all, in any way, shape or form. I thought he was very bad for our country.”

This is hardly the first time Trump has undercut the GOP’s claims to political civility in the face of tragedy. Long before the GOP tried to leverage leftists politicizing Kirk’s death, Trump had repeatedly made light of political violence against his foes (see: Paul Pelosi) and frequently used violent rhetoric.

But the president reupping this kind of language now at least crystallizes the choice for the GOP.

And the choice is as it ever was: between Trump and the moral high ground.

https://joshuafoust.com/2025/09/16/the-new-prime-minister-of-nepal-was-elected-on-discord/,The New Prime Minister of Nepal Was Elected on Discord,"The Nepalese government has been struggling with how to manage the disruptions caused by the mass adoption of social media technologies—much like every other country, developing or advanced. Ever since the monarchy was dissolved in 2008, 14 governments have tried to rule the country, all unsuccessfully. Earlier this month, the government began enforcing a ban on services that wouldn’t register as local entities (a process also enforced against social media companies in countries like India, Pakistan, Russia, and China). Outraged, young people erupted in protests across the country.

But then, something changed. The protests shifted from expressing anger at the ban to rage at corruption. Slogans turned to outright violence: homes torched, vehicles destroyed, and the Singha Durbar, the palace at the center of Kathmandu that houses several government ministries and the parliament, was set on fire. The violence became so widespread and disruptive, nearly 70 people died. The prime minister resigned.

The protests may have begun as anger about losing social media access, but they quickly shifted to anger about corruption in the government. “We want to see an end to corruption in Nepal,” a college student said to the BBC. The young people driving the protests may have never coalesced around a singular leader or movement, but the collective mass of them still organized protests, defenses against police violence, and coordinated calls for resignations and reform. A rallying cry, expressed as a hashtag, was “NepoBaby and #NepoKids — referring to the corrupt practice of hiring family members to government positions, who then lead public, lavish lifestyles. It was a social media revolution.

It is a familiar refrain: a band of corrupt families take over a government, dole out favors and enrich themselves at the public’s expense, and enact violent reprisals when the masses of people who miss out raise voices in protest. While many such protests movements fizzle or are repressed by the police, in Nepal they worked. They toppled the government. So what next?

Public trust in Nepal’s political system has collapsed. It was unclear if a free and fair election could even take place, given the hold corrupt dynasties held over government bodies. One of the student groups, Hami Nepal, filled with Gen Z members, had been running a server on Discord called “Youth Against Corruption” that had amassed 160,000 people—no small feat for a country of 30 million. After the former prime minister resigned, they held a debate with more than 10,000 people to determine where they want the country to go. Thousands more watched the debate on YouTube.

Screenshots from the Discord debate in Nepal

The group eventually settled on Sushila Karki, the former Supreme Court Chief Justice, to become the new prime minister. She took the oath of office, the first woman to ever do so, on Friday September 11.

To call this chain of events unprecedented is underselling things. Fifteen years ago, protests on social media advanced into toppling governments during the Arab Spring, sparking a wave of interest in the organizing power of social media. It was a bit of a myth, the idea that social media drove the regional protests, but it pretty clearly played some role in exposing people to protests and offering the means to organize more. It’s why social media is routinely restricted by non-democratic regimes: they don’t want organizing to get out of their control.

But protests over losing access to social media often look different. They’re rare, certainly at the scale of what happened in Nepal. And to the best of my knowledge, a gaming chat service has never been the venue by which a new government has been formed. Discord, as most people probably realize, is not just used for gaming, though its origins in and connection to gaming culture will never really go away. But it’s reputation as a games forum, along with the simulated privacy that its network provides (it’s not really private, just less accessible by the public), has kept it off the agenda of many governments that openly regulate more traditional forms of social media.

Discord has been used to organize protests before, most infamously the 2017 neo-nazi rally in Charlottesville, VA. And it has hosted extremist groups for even longer, many of whom go to lengths to avoid triggering the site’s limitations on extremism. Discord has even been the site of national security leaks, the extent that it is almost a punchline in security communities.

But electing a new government? That’s new. Places like Estonia have had digital voting over the internet for a long while; it is a straightforward process to create the secure means to do democracy that way. But that requires digital certificates, good encryption, strong credentials, and mass buy-in to work. Nepal has none of those things, nor does Discord. A relatively open forum holding a poll from un-vetted participants to pick the head of a government just… doesn’t happen. I don’t know what else to say about it.

But I will have something to say soon. The intersection of video games and national security is at the core of my research. This “election” (I guess?) in Nepal took me by surprise. I don’t know that anyone really envisioned something like it happening outside of a William Gibson novel. But it did, and now we have to think about a world where a government can be replaced because of a Discord server. I don’t really know what to do with that knowledge, for the time being. But it certainly changes things and changes how I will be thinking about them going forward.

And, I wish Nepal all the best. I really do hope this new government is better for them. We’ll see.",https://joshuafoust.com/2025/09/16/the-new-prime-minister-of-nepal-was-elected-on-discord/,2025-09-16 00:00:00,"The Nepalese government has been struggling with how to manage the disruptions caused by the mass adoption of social media technologies—much like every other country, developing or advanced.

The protests may have begun as anger about losing social media access, but they quickly shifted to anger about corruption in the government. “We want to see an end to corruption in Nepal,” a college student said to the BBC. The young people driving the protests may have never coalesced around a singular leader or movement, but the collective mass of them still organized protests, defenses against police violence, and coordinated calls for resignations and reform. A rallying cry, expressed as a hashtag, was “NepoBaby and #NepoKids — referring to the corrupt practice of hiring family members to government positions, who then lead public, lavish lifestyles. It was a social media revolution. It is a familiar refrain: a band of corrupt families take over a government, dole out favors and enrich themselves at the public’s expense, and enact violent reprisals when the masses of people who miss out raise voices in protest. While many such protests movements fizzle or are repressed by the police, in Nepal they worked. They toppled the government. So what next? Public trust in Nepal’s political system has collapsed. It was unclear if a free and fair election could even take place, given the hold corrupt dynasties held over government bodies. One of the student groups, Hami Nepal, filled with Gen Z members, had been running a server on Discord called “Youth Against Corruption” that had amassed 160,000 people—no small feat for a country of 30 million. After the former prime minister resigned, they held a debate with more than 10,000 people to determine where they want the country to go. Thousands more watched the debate on YouTube. Screenshots from the Discord debate in Nepal The group eventually settled on Sushila Karki, the former Supreme Court Chief Justice, to become the new prime minister. She took the oath of office, the first woman to ever do so, on Friday September 11. To call this chain of events unprecedented is underselling things. Fifteen years ago, protests on social media advanced into toppling governments during the Arab Spring, sparking a wave of interest in the organizing power of social media. It was a bit of a myth, the idea that social media drove the regional protests, but it pretty clearly played some role in exposing people to protests and offering the means to organize more. It’s why social media is routinely restricted by non-democratic regimes: they don’t want organizing to get out of their control. But protests over losing access to social media often look different. They’re rare, certainly at the scale of what happened in Nepal. And to the best of my knowledge, a gaming chat service has never been the venue by which a new government has been formed. Discord, as most people probably realize, is not just used for gaming, though its origins in and connection to gaming culture will never really go away. But it’s reputation as a games forum, along with the simulated privacy that its network provides (it’s not really private, just less accessible by the public), has kept it off the agenda of many governments that openly regulate more traditional forms of social media. Discord has been used to organize protests before, most infamously the 2017 neo-nazi rally in Charlottesville, VA. And it has hosted extremist groups for even longer, many of whom go to lengths to avoid triggering the site’s limitations on extremism. Discord has even been the site of national security leaks, the extent that it is almost a punchline in security communities. But electing a new government? That’s new. Places like Estonia have had digital voting over the internet for a long while; it is a straightforward process to create the secure means to do democracy that way. But that requires digital certificates, good encryption, strong credentials, and mass buy-in to work. Nepal has none of those things, nor does Discord. A relatively open forum holding a poll from un-vetted participants to pick the head of a government just… doesn’t happen. I don’t know what else to say about it. But I will have something to say soon. The intersection of video games and national security is at the core of my research. This “election” (I guess?) in Nepal took me by surprise. I don’t know that anyone really envisioned something like it happening outside of a William Gibson novel. But it did, and now we have to think about a world where a government can be replaced because of a Discord server. I don’t really know what to do with that knowledge, for the time being. But it certainly changes things and changes how I will be thinking about them going forward. And, I wish Nepal all the best. I really do hope this new government is better for them.

WHY THIS MATTERS: Protests in Nepal have revealed the extent of young people’s frustration with the lack of opportunity in the Himalayan nation, as they spiraled into a broader challenge to the government. While around a fifth of young people are unemployed, many note that the children of the political elite seem to enjoy luxury lifestyles and numerous advantages.

KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) — Protests against Nepal’s short-lived ban on social media grew increasingly violent Tuesday as demonstrators set government buildings and politicians’ homes on fire and attacked some leaders. The prime minister resigned amid widening criticism of the country’s political elite.

The resignation appeared to have little effect on the unrest. Tens of thousands of protesters remained on the streets late in the day, blocking roads and storming government facilities. Army helicopters ferried some ministers to safe places.

A day earlier, demonstrations led by young people angry about the blocking of several social media sites gripped the capital, and police opened fire on the crowds, killing 19 people.

The ban was lifted Tuesday, but the protests continued, fueled by rage over the deaths and accusations of political corruption in the nation wedged between China and India.

As the protests escalated, Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli announced he was stepping down. The president accepted the resignation and appointed Oli to lead a caretaker government until a new one is in place — though it was unclear what power he would wield or even where he was.

President Ram Chandra Poudel, the ceremonial head of state, appealed to the protesters to engage in discussions to find a peaceful resolution and stop further escalation.

In a video message, Nepalese army chief Ashok Raj Sigdel urged protesters to stop the demonstrations to prevent further loss of lives and property and to come forward for dialogue.

In a written statement that followed, the army warned that the country’s security forces were committed to preserving law and order. It was not clear if the army, which so far has stayed in its barracks, would be mobilized to help after police failed to control the situation.

U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres urged restraint to avoid further violence and called for both an investigation into the events and dialogue to forge “a constructive path forward,” U.N. spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said.

“He underscored that protests must take place in a peaceful manner, respecting life and property,” and called on Nepalese authorities to comply with international human rights, the spokesperson said.

Focus turns to the government

The demonstrations — called the protest of Gen Z — began after the government blocked platforms, including Facebook, X and YouTube, saying the companies had failed to register and submit to government oversight.

But the protests spiraled to reflect broader discontent. In particular, many young people are angry that the children of political leaders — so-called nepo kids — seem to enjoy luxury lifestyles and numerous advantages while most youth struggle to find work. With youth unemployment running at about 20% last year, according to the World Bank, the government estimates that more than 2,000 young people leave the country every day to seek work in the Middle East or southeast Asia.

“I am here to protest about the massive corruption in our country,” said Bishnu Thapa Chetri, a student. “The country has gotten so bad that for us youths, there is no grounds for us to stay.”

Videos shared on social media showed protesters beating up Nepali Congress party leader Sher Bahadur Deuba and his wife, Arzu Rana Deuba, the current foreign minister. Both appeared to be bleeding, while one video showed the party leader being helped to safety. The party is the country’s largest and is part of the governing coalition.

‘See that justice is done’

Local media and videos on social media also showed protesters attacking government buildings and the residences of the top political leaders throughout Tuesday.

The presidential palace, the prime minister’s official residence and a building that houses the offices of the prime minister and several ministries were all torched. Thick smoke rose from the prime minister’s office building.

Earlier, Oli’s private home was set on fire, as were those of the president, the home minister and the Deubas. The home of the leader of the opposition Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) was also set ablaze.

Some protesters blamed the government for the police opening fire and called for the ouster of the increasingly unpopular prime minister.

“We are here to protest because our youths and friends are getting killed. We are here to see that justice is done and the present regime is ousted,” said Narayan Acharya, who was among the protesters outside the battered wall of the parliament building Tuesday. “K.P. Oli should be chased away.”

Police fire on crowds

Monday’s rallies swelled to tens of thousands of people in Kathmandu and crowds surrounded the Parliament building before police opened fire on the demonstrators.

“Stop the ban on social media. Stop corruption, not social media,” the crowds chanted, waving national flags.

In addition to the 19 fatalities, scores of people were wounded.

Before he resigned, Oli said he would form an investigating committee that would submit a report on the shooting in 15 days. He added that compensation would be given to the families of those who were killed, and that those who were wounded would receive free treatment.

Social media ban

The violence unfolded as Nepal’s government pursues a broader attempt to regulate social media with a bill aimed at ensuring the platforms are “properly managed, responsible and accountable.” The proposal has been widely criticized as a tool for censorship and for punishing government opponents who voice their protests online.

The bill would require companies to appoint a liaison office or a point of contact in the country. Rights groups have called it an attempt by the government to curb freedom of expression and fundamental rights.

The registration requirement applied to about two dozen social networks widely used in Nepal.

Neither Google, which owns YouTube, nor Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, responded to requests for comment from The Associated Press. Elon Musk’s X platform also did not respond.

TikTok, Viber and three other platforms have registered and operated without interruption.

Watch: Celebratory cheers and motorcycle horns in Nepal

Nepal's Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has resigned in the wake of public outrage over the killing of 22 people in police clashes with anti-corruption protesters. His office said he had stepped down to pave the way for a constitutional solution to the massive youth-led protests over widespread allegations of corruption and sparked by a social media ban, which has since been withdrawn. The protests turned violent as thousands – many identifying themselves as Gen Z on placards and banners – took to the streets of Kathmandu on Monday. Almost 200 people are believed to have been injured in clashes with police, who used tear gas, water cannons and live bullets as protesters scaled the walls of the parliament and other official buildings. The protests continued on Tuesday, with demonstrators setting fire to the parliament building, the headquarters of the Nepali Congress Party and the home of former prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba. The homes of several other politicians have also been vandalised. Here's what we know about the protests.

What was the social media ban?

Social media is a big part of Nepali life. Indeed, the country has one of South Asia's highest user rates per capita. The demonstrations were triggered by the government's decision last week to ban 26 social media platforms, including WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook, for failing to meet a deadline to register with Nepal's ministry of communication and information technology. Critics accused the government of seeking to stifle an anti-corruption campaign with the ban, which was repealed on Monday night. While the ban was a catalyst for the current unrest, protesters are also channelling a more deep-rooted dissatisfaction with the country's authorities.

What is happening across Nepal?

The ensuing demonstrations turned violent in Kathmandu and some other cities in Nepal, with 19 protesters dying in clashes with police on Monday. Nepal's Minister for Communication Prithvi Subba told the BBC later that day that police had had to use force - which included water cannons, batons and firing rubber bullets. Some protesters managed to breach the perimeter of the parliament building in Kathmandu, prompting police to impose a curfew around key government buildings and tighten security. On Tuesday, protesters also set fire to parliament in the capital Kathmandu, sending thick black smoke billowing into the sky. Government buildings and the houses of political leaders were attacked around the country. At least three people were reported to have been killed on Tuesday, bringing the total death toll to at least 22 since the unrest began. Many of the injured have been taken to local hospitals where crowds have gathered. BBC Nepali spoke to doctors who said they had treated gunshot wounds and injuries from rubber bullets. Police have said several officers were also wounded, with casualty figures expected to increase.

Who is calling the shots now?

On Tuesday evening, Nepal's army chief, General Ashok Raj Sigdel, issued a statement accusing demonstrators of taking advantage of the current crisis by damaging, looting and setting fire to public and private property. If unrest continued, the statement said, ""all security institutions, including the Nepal Army, are committed to taking control of the situation."" At the same time, Gen General Ashok Raj Sigdel invited protesters to engage in dialogue to find a solution to Nepal's worst unrest in decades. It remains unclear, however, who is leading the country at this point. The army's statement doesn't clarify what action it could take, or if it would use force to control the protesters. But they are already on the streets to exercise control over those ""who are trying to take advantage from the adverse situation in the country and are involved in looting, arson and vandalism"". It's also unclear who will represent the protesters if they do engage in dialogue with the army. These protests have not been led by a group or a person, and in fact started as a response to a callout on social media platforms. The one political figure who has openly supported the protest is the Mayor of Kathmandu Metropolitan city, Balen Shah. He has been making appeals for restraint from his social media account.

Who is protesting?

Roused on social media and led by the nation's young people, this protest is unlike any seen before in Nepal. The demonstrators identify as Gen Z, and the term has become a rallying symbol throughout the movement. Although there has been no central point of leadership, a number of youth collectives have emerged as a mobilising force, issuing calls to action and sharing updates online. Students from colleges and universities across Nepal's major cities - Kathmandu, Pokhara and Itahari - have been invited to join in uniform, books in hand, while videos circulating on social media show even schoolchildren participating in the marches.

What are the protesters' demands?

Their two main demands have been clear: the government lifting the ban on social media, which has now happened, and officials putting an end to what they call ""corrupt practices"". Protesters, many of them college students, have linked the social media blockade with curtailing freedom of speech, and widespread allegations of corruption among politicians. ""We want to see an end to corruption in Nepal,"" Binu KC, a 19-year-old college student, told BBC Nepali. ""Leaders promise one thing during elections but never deliver. They are the cause of so many problems."" She added the social media ban had disrupted her education, limiting access to online classes and study resources. Subhana Budhathoki, a content creator, echoed the frustration: ""Gen Z will not stop now. This protest is about more than just social media - it's about silencing our voices, and we won't let that happen.""

What is the 'NepoKids' trend and how is it related to these protests?

A defining feature of the protest has been the widespread use of two slogans -#Nepo Baby and #Nepo Kids. These two terms have gained popularity on social media in the past few weeks after a number of videos showing the lavish lifestyles of politicians and their families went viral in Nepal. Protesters argue these individuals enjoy success and luxury without merit, living off public money while ordinary Nepalis struggle. Viral videos on TikTok and Instagram have contrasted the lavish lifestyles of political families — involving designer clothes, foreign travel and luxury cars — with the harsh realities faced by young people, including unemployment and forced migration. The slogans have become symbolic of a deeper frustration with inequality, as protesters compare the lives of the elite with those of everyday citizens.

The homes of several other politicians have also been vandalised. Here's what we know about the protests. AFP via Getty Images A police barricade is pictured in front of a fire started by demonstrators outside parliament What was the social media ban? Social media is a big part of Nepali life. Indeed, the country has one of South Asia's highest user rates per capita. The demonstrations were triggered by the government's decision last week to ban 26 social media platforms, including WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook, for failing to meet a deadline to register with Nepal's ministry of communication and information technology. Critics accused the government of seeking to stifle an anti-corruption campaign with the ban, which was repealed on Monday night. While the ban was a catalyst for the current unrest, protesters are also channelling a more deep-rooted dissatisfaction with the country's authorities. What is happening across Nepal? The ensuing demonstrations turned violent in Kathmandu and some other cities in Nepal, with 19 protesters dying in clashes with police on Monday. Nepal's Minister for Communication Prithvi Subba told the BBC later that day that police had had to use force - which included water cannons, batons and firing rubber bullets. Some protesters managed to breach the perimeter of the parliament building in Kathmandu, prompting police to impose a curfew around key government buildings and tighten security. On Tuesday, protesters also set fire to parliament in the capital Kathmandu, sending thick black smoke billowing into the sky. Government buildings and the houses of political leaders were attacked around the country. At least three people were reported to have been killed on Tuesday, bringing the total death toll to at least 22 since the unrest began. Many of the injured have been taken to local hospitals where crowds have gathered. BBC Nepali spoke to doctors who said they had treated gunshot wounds and injuries from rubber bullets. Police have said several officers were also wounded, with casualty figures expected to increase. Who is calling the shots now? On Tuesday evening, Nepal's army chief, General Ashok Raj Sigdel, issued a statement accusing demonstrators of taking advantage of the current crisis by damaging, looting and setting fire to public and private property. If unrest continued, the statement said, ""all security institutions, including the Nepal Army, are committed to taking control of the situation."" At the same time, Gen General Ashok Raj Sigdel invited protesters to engage in dialogue to find a solution to Nepal's worst unrest in decades. It remains unclear, however, who is leading the country at this point. The army's statement doesn't clarify what action it could take, or if it would use force to control the protesters. But they are already on the streets to exercise control over those ""who are trying to take advantage from the adverse situation in the country and are involved in looting, arson and vandalism"". It's also unclear who will represent the protesters if they do engage in dialogue with the army. These protests have not been led by a group or a person, and in fact started as a response to a callout on social media platforms. The one political figure who has openly supported the protest is the Mayor of Kathmandu Metropolitan city, Balen Shah. He has been making appeals for restraint from his social media account. Getty Images Protesters clash with police outside parliament in Kathmandu Who is protesting? Roused on social media and led by the nation's young people, this protest is unlike any seen before in Nepal. The demonstrators identify as Gen Z, and the term has become a rallying symbol throughout the movement. Although there has been no central point of leadership, a number of youth collectives have emerged as a mobilising force, issuing calls to action and sharing updates online. Students from colleges and universities across Nepal's major cities - Kathmandu, Pokhara and Itahari - have been invited to join in uniform, books in hand, while videos circulating on social media show even schoolchildren participating in the marches. Getty Images Thousands of youth protesting against the social media ban What are the protesters' demands? Their two main demands have been clear: the government lifting the ban on social media, which has now happened, and officials putting an end to what they call ""corrupt practices"". Protesters, many of them college students, have linked the social media blockade with curtailing freedom of speech, and widespread allegations of corruption among politicians. ""We want to see an end to corruption in Nepal,"" Binu KC, a 19-year-old college student, told BBC Nepali. ""Leaders promise one thing during elections but never deliver. They are the cause of so many problems."" She added the social media ban had disrupted her education, limiting access to online classes and study resources. Subhana Budhathoki, a content creator, echoed the frustration: ""Gen Z will not stop now. This protest is about more than just social media - it's about silencing our voices, and we won't let that happen."" Getty Images The Gen Z group protests against corruption and the ban on social media platforms What is the 'NepoKids' trend and how is it related to these protests? A defining feature of the protest has been the widespread use of two slogans -#Nepo Baby and #Nepo Kids. These two terms have gained popularity on social media in the past few weeks after a number of videos showing the lavish lifestyles of politicians and their families went viral in Nepal. Protesters argue these individuals enjoy success and luxury without merit, living off public money while ordinary Nepalis struggle. Viral videos on TikTok and Instagram have contrasted the lavish lifestyles of political families — involving designer clothes, foreign travel and luxury cars — with the harsh realities faced by young people, including unemployment and forced migration. The slogans have become symbolic of a deeper frustration with inequality, as protesters compare the lives of the elite with those of everyday citizens.

In the aftermath of the January 6 right-wing insurrection on Capitol Hill in Washington, the role social media played in these events came into the media spotlight in the United States. For years, fringe ideologues had used online platforms undisturbed to promote their extreme ideologies and conspiracies and recruit a large number of sympathisers to their extremist causes.

Eventually, the rage they had been inciting poured out into the real world and led to the deadly storming of the congressional building, shaking the very foundations of American democracy. When social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook took action, many recognised that it was too little, too late.

Although the January 6 riots took almost everyone by surprise, we, in the Arab world, have known for a while that these social media platforms are a threat to democracy. For far too long, Big Tech companies have been allowed to be the ultimate arbiters on free speech online and a haven for hate speech and disinformation. They have piggybacked on the idea that they helped trigger the Arab Spring and are therefore are a force for freedom and democracy.

Ten years after the onset of the Arab revolutions, Facebook, Twitter, and Google have turned into powerful enablers of vast disinformation campaigns, harassment, censorship, and incitement of violence against activists, journalists, human rights defenders and any dissenting voice.

Far from a revolutionary or even a democracy tool, social media in the Arab world has now become a powerful and dangerous political medium. And despite repeated complaints and calls for action from Arab activists and civil organisations, none of the Big Tech companies behind these social media platforms has made any major efforts to stem these abuses and change their policies.

Busting the social media myth

During the early days of the Arab uprisings, when many activists were using Facebook and Twitter to organise and amplify their demands, the social media giants seized the opportunity to brand themselves as platforms for political activism and resistance. To this day, numerous media outlets run the claim that “social media made the Arab Spring” and that it was a “Facebook revolution”.

But social scientists have repeatedly busted this myth and have offered critical readings of the role these tech companies have played in the political unrest in Tunisia, Egypt, and other Arab countries.

In 2011, Lisa Anderson, who at that time was the president of the American University in Cairo, noted that “Egyptian Facebook campaigners are the modern incarnation of [early] Arab nationalist networks”, and that the “important story” about the Arab Spring is not the use of social media technology, but how revolutionary aspirations resonated across the Arab world.

In a 2012 academic article, media scholars William Youmans and Jillian York argued that the policies of social media companies actually limited collective action in some ways and inhibited political activism. In a 2015 paper, economist Chonghyun Byun and political scientist Ethan Hollander concluded that there is no significant correlation between internet or social media use and popular unrest.

Beyond the traditional debate between cybers-sceptics and cyber-enthusiasts, what is evident to those who witnessed the early days of the Arab revolutions is that social media was just one channel of social and political networking among many others that contributed to the onset of the protest movements.

Yet, Big Tech corporations have insidiously used the myth of social media as an “Arab Spring platform” to their benefit to expand their user numbers, boost engagement, and provide a veneer of respectability to their flawed business models. They have also employed it to counter criticism and efforts to impose regulation on them and to disregard frequent demands and campaigns by Arab civil organisations and digital right activists to protect online privacy and the right to free speech.

The dangerous failure of content moderation

Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, and Google have also shown little interest in building strong, straightforward mechanisms of content moderation to prevent the spread of hate speech and disinformation on their platforms in the Middle East and North Africa.

Despite posing as a force for progress and development, Big Tech was collaborating with repressive governments in the Middle East and North Africa even before the Arab Spring started. For example, in 2011, US embassy cables published by Wikileaks revealed that in 2006 Microsoft had agreed to train law enforcement officers in IT in exchange for President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali’s government going back on its decision to use open-source software.

After the outbreak of the Arab Spring, Arab states felt the need to control even more the online activities of their citizens. Instead of protecting free speech against government censorship efforts, social media platforms suspended and removed thousands of accounts of political dissidents in Tunisia, Palestine, Egypt, Syria and elsewhere. They have also arbitrarily taken down content that advocated for free speech, justice, and basic human rights and have offered no explanation for doing so.

This is what led the Lebanon-based organisation SMEX, which advocates for digital rights in the Arab region, to pen an open letter signed by more than 40 civil organisations, calling on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to stop silencing critical voices in the Middle East and North Africa. “Arbitrary and non-transparent account suspension and removal of political and dissenting speech has become so frequent and systematic that they cannot be dismissed as isolated incidents or the result of transitory errors in automated decision-making,” the letter said.

Social media companies have also done little to counter the growing use of social engineering, disinformation and troll operations on their platforms. In Saudi Arabia, for example, “a troll army” was put together to suppress any expression of dissent on social media networks like Twitter.

In Tunisia, Facebook pages were weaponised ahead of the 2019 elections to spread political messaging by unknown political actors in an attempt to sway the vote. A report by Democracy Reporting International Tunisia and the Tunisian Association for Integrity and Democracy of Elections (ATIDE) noted that the absence of a proper Facebook Ads Library for Tunisia contributed to the lack of transparency that enabled these subversive political campaigns.

We also still do not know how these corporations take decisions regarding suspension of accounts and posts because they have offered no transparency about their content moderation practices. In 2019 and 2020, Twitter and Facebook disclosed they suspended and removed hundreds of accounts “for engaging in coordinated inauthentic behavior”, which includes disinformation, spamming, and state-backed manipulation. Compared with the unfathomable number of trolls and bots on Arab social media, these numbers are laughable.

They not only demonstrate that current content moderation practices are failing but also that social media corporations are unwilling to address the dangerous role their platforms are playing in undermining democratic movements and dissent and promoting the regressive and violent policies of repressive governments.

The impossible case for accountability

During the past few years, Tunisia’s ATIDE, Lebanon’s SMEX, and Egypt’s Arabic Network for Human Rights Information, as well as international civil rights organisations like Access Now and Electronic Frontier Foundation, have actively advocated for immediate action to counter disinformation and hate speech on social media in the Middle East and North Africa.

They have called on Big Tech companies to cease their unfair discriminatory practices, to invest in regional expertise of content moderation and become more transparent about policies and procedures.

Yet, despite the large of number of campaigns and the alarming evidence that digital threats to democracy are getting more dangerous and widespread, Big Tech companies continue to downplay their critical role in undermining democratic movements and free speech in the Arab world and ignore calls to implement urgent, long-term reforms.

Facebook and Twitter often seek to dodge responsibility and demands for more accountability by referring to the novelty of the field. In a 2018 blog post about the effect that social media have on democracy, Samidh Chakrabarti, a product manager of civic engagement at Facebook, concluded that “this is a new frontier”.

However, none of this is new. Discursive violence broadcasted on traditional or new media has always been instrumental in inciting political violence on a massive scale. The horrors of colonialism, the Holocaust, the Rwandan genocide, etc were all made conceivable in the public space by various media platforms spreading hate speech that legitimated the dehumanisation of and mass violence against the “other”.

In the Middle East and North Africa, it unlikely that legally-enforced accountability will be enforced, as local governments are unlikely to pass legislation that would punish abusive practices that they themselves engage in. Meanwhile, laws enacted in the West to regulate social media platforms may not apply elsewhere and there may not be the political will to apply them in the Global South.

Expecting Big Tech corporations to start regulating themselves is also futile. As digital economy scholar Nick Srnicek argues, the death drive of platform capitalism and its complete disregard for democratic principles of privacy and free speech are integral features of Big Tech companies’ business models. For them, profits outweigh any ethical or political costs they may incur.

In the Arab world, this irresponsible profit-driven behaviour has led to the brutalisation of the digital public space, the extremist tribalisation of political discourse, and the incitement of political violence.

Social media companies are too powerful, or too broken, to truly self-regulate or be regulated. The only ethical and logical solution is to dismantle them.

How Estonia's online votes are processed. Source: valimised.ee

The RVT explained that several amendments to the Riigikogu Election Act entered into force in 2021. Among other changes, voters were granted the opportunity to override their electronically cast vote by voting via paper ballot at a polling place located within their designated voting precinct on Election Day.

This means, however, that online votes cannot be tallied until precincts have wrapped up their work on Election Day night.

Once all precincts have finished their work, a list of people who have voted in person at polling places within a precinct is submitted to Estonia's central online voting system.

The list of people who voted in person by paper ballot on Election Day is then compared with the list of people who have voted online, and repeat votes are annulled, with a vote by paper ballot cast on Election Day overriding the same voter's previous, online vote.

How Estonia's online votes are processed. Source: valimised.ee

Once repeat votes have been checked for and annulled, the process of anonymizing electronic votes begins, in which voters' personal data, i.e. their digital signature, is separated from their vote, leaving only encrypted information regarding a voter's selection.

Prior to being opened, these encrypted online votes are also mixed in order to make it impossible to match the encrypted votes with voters' personal data.

After online votes have been mixed, they can be decrypted with a private key, which is divided between several members of the National Electoral Committee (Vabariigi Valimiskomisjon, VVK) and the RVT. At least five keepers of the key shares must be present to open the votes.

This key is used to decrypt, or open, the mixed votes, after which they can begin to be tallied.

Once electronic votes have been counted, a counting certificate is issued confirming the correct opening of the votes cast online and can be checked using an audit application. This certificate makes it possible to check whether an unencrypted vote and cryptogram are interconnected based on the public key.

How Estonia's online votes are processed. Source: valimised.ee

All of these procedures take time, and before any operations involved in the process are initiated, they are described to election observers in Estonian and English. How long some processes take depends in part on the number of electronic votes as well.

Everyone has the right to participate as an observer as electronic votes are counted and recounted, as well as to participate in electronic vote observer training.

Electoral Office chief: Entire online voting process can be checked

Estonia's online voting results were released late Sunday night, several hours after polling places closed their doors on Election Day. Previously, online voting results were available much sooner. In an appearance on Vikerraadio's ""Uudis+"" on Monday, RVT director Arne Koitmäe explained that this was the result of changes to the online voting system introduced by amendments to the Riigikogu Election Act.

""As with paper ballots, online voting results only start being verified after voting has concluded — after 8 p.m. on Election Day,"" Koitmäe explained. ""There's been a change here in that while [verification] began before 8 p.m. already in the elections before last, now, because a voter can annul their electronic vote by voting via paper ballot all the way up to the night of Election Day, we don't initiate these procedures until it's certain that voting has concluded at all precincts.""

Electronic votes and paper ballots are checked electronically against signatures. ""A voter provides their signature [to confirm] they are voting, and the same is noted in a list of voters as well,"" he continued. ""And that list of voters is electronic, so after voting has ended, the election information system forwards that data to the online voting system.""

Conservative People's Party of Estonia (EKRE) chair Martin Helme announced that his party intends to challenge the election results, claiming that online voting distorted the results of the elections.

According to Koitmäe, however, it isn't possible to manipulate Estonia's electronic votes.

""This system is specifically designed to allow for the entire process to be checked,"" the electoral official underscored.

""In other words, first of all, as online voting is underway, all votes are digitally signed by voters, and when these votes are received by a so-called virtual ballot box, these votes are also registered by a third party, i.e. a registration service,"" he explained.

""And once voting concludes, this data is compared to ensure that no votes have been either added to or removed from that box,"" he continued. ""And as votes are being counted, the system also issues a dedicated counting certificate which mathematically demonstrates that these votes have been tallied correctly. And third parties can verify this as well. Anyone at all can actually write their own audit application and test whether the results are accurate or not.""

Estonian elections' online voting is monitored by auditors as well. According to Koitmäe, this year's Riigikogu elections were monitored by KPMG auditors.

""Auditors ensure the accuracy of procedures as well as conduct a full online voting dataset check — they verify that the integrity of the data is ensured and that the results are accurate,"" he explained.

The RVT official said that vote counting procedures are public and that EKRE representatives can also verify the data for themselves if they'd like. He noted that electronic votes can be recounted just like paper ballots.

Both electronic vote and paper ballot recounts were conducted in Estonia on Monday, and the final results of the 2023 Riigikogu elections would be clear by Monday night.

This result won't be officially confirmed, however, until all election complaints are resolved or the deadline for submitting complaints has passed.

Electronic votes and paper ballots are preserved until all complaints have been finally settled in the Supreme Court of Estonia.

Ministry official: Security ensured by digital double envelope system

Liisa Past, director of the Cybersecurity Department at the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications, stressed that in Estonia, legislation governs the requirements imposed on various types of voting.

Online voting is just one of several ways to cast your ballot in Estonian elections, alongside voting at Estonian embassies abroad or having a ballot box brought to you at home, a care facility or even the hospital.

""In other words, the law requires, among other things, that voting be secret, and that one person may cast one vote,"" Past said. ""Among ways this is ensured is the fact that, by casting their electronic vote with a digital signature, a person forms an outer envelope as such.""

Much, she noted, like one physical envelope containing a ballot is placed inside another bearing identifying info when voting absentee by mail. Secrecy is ensured in much the same way with electronic voting in Estonia, only the double envelope system in question is digital.

There are several additional procedures and cryptographic measures, i.e. mathematical verification, to ensure that the ballots going into the digital ballot box are the same ones to come out.

According to Past, each stage of the voting process must be traceable and documented, and any changes in electronic votes will be reflected in logs.

""First of all, this electronic [ballot box] is encrypted, and second, every one of the votes inside it is protected by a digital signature,"" she explained. ""And every step taken is logged, which means that changes made can be seen in the log as well.""

The cybersecurity official noted that cryptographic measures will indicate whether any content has been modified.

""And on the flipside, all actions taken leave a trace, i.e. technical log, where every change, every action is likewise traceable,"" she added.

Past confirmed that Estonia's online elections are also monitored by observers who are trained beforehand.

""In addition, both the electronic voting system as well as the election information system are audited in accordance with information security standards,"" she highlighted. ""An international audit company has also conducted an independent assessment; that report is publicly available as well.""

More than half of all votes cast online

In all, 312,181 people voted online in the 2023 Riigikogu elections, accounting for just over half of all 610,320 ballots cast, according to the latest data from the RVT.

This set a new online voting record for Estonia as well as marked the first time that more than half of all votes cast in an election have been cast online.

This certificate makes it possible to check whether an unencrypted vote and cryptogram are interconnected based on the public key. How Estonia's online votes are processed. Source: valimised.ee All of these procedures take time, and before any operations involved in the process are initiated, they are described to election observers in Estonian and English. How long some processes take depends in part on the number of electronic votes as well. Everyone has the right to participate as an observer as electronic votes are counted and recounted, as well as to participate in electronic vote observer training. Electoral Office chief: Entire online voting process can be checked Estonia's online voting results were released late Sunday night, several hours after polling places closed their doors on Election Day. Previously, online voting results were available much sooner. In an appearance on Vikerraadio's ""Uudis+"" on Monday, RVT director Arne Koitmäe explained that this was the result of changes to the online voting system introduced by amendments to the Riigikogu Election Act. ""As with paper ballots, online voting results only start being verified after voting has concluded — after 8 p.m. on Election Day,"" Koitmäe explained. ""There's been a change here in that while [verification] began before 8 p.m. already in the elections before last, now, because a voter can annul their electronic vote by voting via paper ballot all the way up to the night of Election Day, we don't initiate these procedures until it's certain that voting has concluded at all precincts."" Electronic votes and paper ballots are checked electronically against signatures. ""A voter provides their signature [to confirm] they are voting, and the same is noted in a list of voters as well,"" he continued. ""And that list of voters is electronic, so after voting has ended, the election information system forwards that data to the online voting system."" Conservative People's Party of Estonia (EKRE) chair Martin Helme announced that his party intends to challenge the election results, claiming that online voting distorted the results of the elections. According to Koitmäe, however, it isn't possible to manipulate Estonia's electronic votes. ""This system is specifically designed to allow for the entire process to be checked,"" the electoral official underscored. ""In other words, first of all, as online voting is underway, all votes are digitally signed by voters, and when these votes are received by a so-called virtual ballot box, these votes are also registered by a third party, i.e. a registration service,"" he explained. ""And once voting concludes, this data is compared to ensure that no votes have been either added to or removed from that box,"" he continued. ""And as votes are being counted, the system also issues a dedicated counting certificate which mathematically demonstrates that these votes have been tallied correctly. And third parties can verify this as well. Anyone at all can actually write their own audit application and test whether the results are accurate or not."" Estonian elections' online voting is monitored by auditors as well. According to Koitmäe, this year's Riigikogu elections were monitored by KPMG auditors. ""Auditors ensure the accuracy of procedures as well as conduct a full online voting dataset check — they verify that the integrity of the data is ensured and that the results are accurate,"" he explained. The RVT official said that vote counting procedures are public and that EKRE representatives can also verify the data for themselves if they'd like. He noted that electronic votes can be recounted just like paper ballots. Both electronic vote and paper ballot recounts were conducted in Estonia on Monday, and the final results of the 2023 Riigikogu elections would be clear by Monday night. This result won't be officially confirmed, however, until all election complaints are resolved or the deadline for submitting complaints has passed. Electronic votes and paper ballots are preserved until all complaints have been finally settled in the Supreme Court of Estonia. Ministry official: Security ensured by digital double envelope system Liisa Past, director of the Cybersecurity Department at the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications, stressed that in Estonia, legislation governs the requirements imposed on various types of voting. Online voting is just one of several ways to cast your ballot in Estonian elections, alongside voting at Estonian embassies abroad or having a ballot box brought to you at home, a care facility or even the hospital. ""In other words, the law requires, among other things, that voting be secret, and that one person may cast one vote,"" Past said. ""Among ways this is ensured is the fact that, by casting their electronic vote with a digital signature, a person forms an outer envelope as such."" Much, she noted, like one physical envelope containing a ballot is placed inside another bearing identifying info when voting absentee by mail. Secrecy is ensured in much the same way with electronic voting in Estonia, only the double envelope system in question is digital. There are several additional procedures and cryptographic measures, i.e. mathematical verification, to ensure that the ballots going into the digital ballot box are the same ones to come out. According to Past, each stage of the voting process must be traceable and documented, and any changes in electronic votes will be reflected in logs. ""First of all, this electronic [ballot box] is encrypted, and second, every one of the votes inside it is protected by a digital signature,"" she explained. ""And every step taken is logged, which means that changes made can be seen in the log as well."" The cybersecurity official noted that cryptographic measures will indicate whether any content has been modified. ""And on the flipside, all actions taken leave a trace, i.e. technical log, where every change, every action is likewise traceable,"" she added. Past confirmed that Estonia's online elections are also monitored by observers who are trained beforehand. ""In addition, both the electronic voting system as well as the election information system are audited in accordance with information security standards,"" she highlighted. ""An international audit company has also conducted an independent assessment; that report is publicly available as well."" More than half of all votes cast online In all, 312,181 people voted online in the 2023 Riigikogu elections, accounting for just over half of all 610,320 ballots cast, according to the latest data from the RVT. This set a new online voting record for Estonia as well as marked the first time that more than half of all votes cast in an election have been cast online. -- Follow ERR News on Facebook and Twitter and never miss an update!",0.0393367638650657,0.3538164665523155,neutral,"{'neg': 0.013, 'neu': 0.931, 'pos': 0.056, 'compound': 0.9945}",positive

https://joshuafoust.com/2025/09/16/the-new-prime-minister-of-nepal-was-elected-on-discord/,The New York Times is not a Liberal Newspaper,"There is a broad tendency in aesthetically liberal settings—a slippery term I am using to signal an interest in the humanistic discourse of “liberal aesthetics” without engaging in that discourse—to pantomime concern for groups of people without actually engaging in those people’s humanity. I call them aesthetically liberal because they aren’t really an example of the philosophy of aesthetics, but instead because they like the look and feel and liberalism but find the political implementation of liberalism (securing individual rights, protecting individual liberty, democratic representation, political and legal equity, private property, etc.) rather distasteful.

Examples of cultural elites who wave at liberalism without behaving liberally in any recognizable way abound, from Silicon Valley CEOs to vast swaths of our political establishment: people who talk a big game about individual freedom and rights but then work tirelessly to constrain those freedoms. You know what I mean, and if you don’t, well, this is just a blog post. Sorry.

I bring all of this up because I think it helps to describe the reasons why, despite no evidence that they have been liberal for a long while now, most people still casually assume that establishment news media in the US is liberal. This is, perhaps, because one of the tenets of journalism involves agenda setting what issues people should care about and what they shouldn’t. It’s hard to discuss this without discussing The New York Times: A few years ago, some political scientists mapped out how stories percolate through establishment media outlets and found that, while less than 1% of the US ever reads the NYT on any given day, how the paper covers issues nevertheless shapes a vast ecosystem of information sources that reaches a far larger indirect audience. In other words, even if very few people directly read how the NYT covers something, the way they cover it still affects how they’ll hear about it.

The recent (failing) push by CNN anchor Jake Tapper and Axios White House correspondent Alex Thompson to get interest in their book (by comparing it to Watergate, incredibly) is a good example of this. The New York Times covered Biden’s age almost 11x more than any policy issue Trump ran on, despite their being only three years apart in age and despite Trump’s incoherent ramblings that deeply alarmed non-American journalists. It is natural to assume that Biden’s age was incredibly important as a result of that coverage, but low sales (around 5% of the sales a typical Bob Woodward politics book gets in its first week) and cratered ratings for his show might be pointing to a different issue: while agenda setting is a real phenomenon, it is not a physical law. People can reject coverage if it feels either disconnected from reality or incongruent with other stories in the news, something Maxwell McCombs called the “perceived civic relevance.” In other words, Biden’s age will feel like an important story while he is running for office; but 7+ months after he is no longer in charge of anything, his age will feel much less relevant to the public.

So, who cares? The anchor of a dying CNN show tried to capitalize on a story whose prevalence he misread for probably interesting reasons (I bet there’s a neat story behind why so many conservative media outlets are covering his ratings collapse but liberal ones aren’t), but what does that have to do with whether or not The New York Times is liberal?

I think it’s the role of the New York Times in our cultural and political imaginary. And, it has some pretty major implications for society. Last week, the Times ran a news story about how Apple is trying to adjust to President Trump’s chaotic tariffs policy. In this news story, they wrote the following line:

Young Chinese women have small fingers, and that has made them a valuable contributor to iPhone production because they are more nimble at installing screws and other miniature parts in the small device, supply chain experts said.

If that sounds pretty textually racist, you’d be correct: doctors and scientists who study limb mobility and design prosthetics have studied this and Chinese women do not have particularly unique fingers—it’s just something racist that some random guy said. Julia Carrie Wong, a reporter for The Guardian, emailed the correspondent about his phrasing and sourcing for this, and got a jaw-dropping reply: “Our reporting does not make racial or genetic generalizations, but simply cites experts who have experience with the industrial process in U.S. and Chinese factories.” She posts additional context showing that these “experts” were found on a right wing podcast using explicitly racial characterizations to describe manufacturing policy.

It’s pretty bad. Equally bad has been the NYT’s years-long crusade to harm queer people. I won’t recount it in detail, but a few years ago over 180 of their contributors wrote an open letter to the paper’s editors begging them to stop being so transphobic in their coverage; the paper was as dismissive of these complaints as they were about Wong’s concern over their explicitly anti-Chinese racism. The Times’s transphobia has deep roots at the paper, which has been at the center of mainstream homophobia for decades. Their unambiguous queerphobia isn’t quite as historical as that link might suggest: during the first Trump term, they weren’t shy about running homophobic political cartoons. It is part of the project of AG Sulzberger, the third-generation owner of the paper, to “challenge” their liberal readership by taking intentionally oppositional stances to many common liberal beliefs, like (in the case of their coverage of President Trump) democracy and the right to speak freely.

There is a lot of denialism about what the Grey Lady has become, as a result. “Media bias” websites rate the paper as strongly liberal, bordering on left wing, and it escapes me why (they’ll claim it is based on things like wording and coverage bias, but as this post shows those are highly unreliable measures and require narrow selection to arrive at the label). The owner and publisher of the newspaper can say he is “not the resistance” and is “nobody’s cheerleader,” then run racist and homophobic stories that align with conservative beliefs, and still get called liberal by people based on those same words. It seems like a break with reality.

Unless, that is, you consider that many people in this portion of the media view liberalism as an aesthetic choice to be not-Republican, as opposed to harboring any sort of liberal beliefs. If the NYT were truly liberal, they would have spent decades antagonizing queer people. They wouldn’t defend publishing racist portrayals of Asian people. Their senior correspondents wouldn’t hector and sneer at liberals using a preposterous definition of corruption designed to exculpate the corrupt Republican in the White House. If this is liberalism, it doesn’t really look like how I imagined it.

Or, another way to look at it, is to ask what their editors actually do. Just this week, one of their opinion editors, Michal Leibowitz, wrote a long essay about why millennials are not having children in numbers high enough to please her sensibilities. Keep in mind that birthrates and fertility are a constant bugaboo of fascists like Elon Musk—just raising the topic in the way she did (she does not once mention this movement despite her own paper covering these far right wing weirdos) is adopting right wing framing. She even discounts or ignores liberal perspectives on birthrates, such as the astronomical cost of child rearing and the rise of mass gun violence in schools (both topics, again, that her own paper has covered). She even ignores the fact that this right wing “natalism” emerged as non-white births outpaced white births in the US. But then, she does something interesting: she starts to blame therapy for why some children have cut off their parents.

I hope @atrios isn’t too mad I replicated his highlight job on this.

To put this in plain language: this is a New York Times editor saying it is a “nearly impossible standard for parenting” for children to be angry at “emotional, physical or sexual abuse.” She is clear that these children are wrong to cut off their parents over such abuse, and she argues, in part (and acknowledges she says this without evidence) that such cutting off is why millennials aren’t popping out kids like the Baby Boomers did.

One could respond to this with reason—sexually abusing a children is a perfectly valid reason to cut off contact with someone—or, one could note that these scare stories about parental estrangement are always told from the perspective of the parent and are vanishingly thin on the details of why it happened. But we could also just look at the Times’ coverage, some of which I summarized above, for clues about how dishonest this right wing framing is. For example, some of that transphobic coverage their own contributors complained about pulls this same maneuver: the parents’ emotions, their entitlement to control their children’s minds and bodies, is what drives the story… not any concerns for the children themselves. Around half of all LGBTQ+ youth, millions of people, are estranged from at least one parent as a result of their identity—notice how concern for those kids does not enter into their coverage decisions? A child cutting off a parent for abuse is cruel and has society implications, but a parent cutting off their kid for being gay or trans is immaterial and not worth mentioning. The estrangement only counts if the parent is the target.

This concern—parents matter, but kids are just accessories the parents get to control and frame—is a fundamentally right wing belief system. That is the “parents rights” thing you see in so many Republican campaigns to attack educators, commit blood libel against queer people, and to ban books about the Holocaust and Harriett Tubman. It denies the personhood of young people, communicates that their feelings and experiences don’t matter, and demands blood fealty even as the risk of physical and sexual abuse. Again, this is from an editor at the “liberal” New York Times. The only liberalism here is the label—there are no identifiable liberal values in this rather low-quality writing, nor is there evidence to suggest that they are adopting liberal belief systems as a consistent frame or conceptual touchpoint in their stories.

Liberalism is an appealing aesthetic. But as an aesthetic, it is empty: liberals may like to show off their reading it, but let’s stop accepting the lazy hand wave that calls it liberal for seemingly arbitrary reasons. The New York Times adopts the aesthetics of liberalism in its leadership and coverage, but the work it does as a newspaper is deeply, abusively conservative.",https://joshuafoust.com/2025/05/31/the-new-york-times-is-not-a-liberal-newspaper/,2025-05-31 00:00:00,"There is a broad tendency in aesthetically liberal settings—a slippery term I am using to signal an interest in the humanistic discourse of “liberal aesthetics” without engaging in that discourse—to pantomime concern for groups of people without actually engaging in those people’s humanity.

It feels like a relevant topic these days, but I’m also proud of the pun in the title that got a good laugh when I presented it at AEJMC. The abstract is below:

“Video game research relating to gender often focuses on the problematic expressions of masculinity but rarely asks what masculinity does. I introduce affect theory as one way to start directly investigating how masculinity shapes the field of video games, including, but not limited to, its position as a driver of sexist abuse. Affect theory, an established tool in feminist and queer research, posits that feelings are embodied and move between bodies, which allows video games to be treated as affective objects. Therefore, studying video game players through the lens of affect theory has the promise to offer new insights into the role masculine genders play in the often contentious sexual politics of gaming. I introduce the idea of affective masculinity as a framework for thinking of men as permeable, emotional subjects. Applied to gaming, it offers a new perspective on how emotion, gender, and behavior intersect.”

Put differently, this theoretical tool gives us the means to ask more questions about where media behavior comes from, as well as unexpected ways to start answering them. Affective masculinity, the concept I develop in the piece, is a way for researchers to move beyond two important limitations in a lot of video games research: the sterile, artificial university environments where psychological experiments are conducted, usually on students; and the self-reporting surveys that ask people to remember their play and emotional state after the fact. By addressing masculinity as a complex state of being, it also moves beyond the cheap problematization of masculinity that we see in a lot of gender research into gaming, as well.

https://constitutionaldiscourse.com/democracy-in-the-age-of-discord-nepals-gen-z-chooses-leader-through-social-media/,Democracy in the Age of Discord: Nepal’s Gen-Z chooses leader through social media,"On September 8, 2025, Nepal saw the biggest protest in decades, on account of social media being banned in the country. Consequently, the government collapsed, and the Parliament of Nepal essentially moved to Discord, where more than 100,000 citizens met in a virtual chat room to choose an interim leader to oversee elections scheduled for March 5, 2026. This resulted in Former Supreme Court justice Sushila S Karki being sworn in as Nepal’s interim Prime Minister on September 12, 2025.

These dramatic events force us to confront deeper questions: what is democracy when social media becomes central to political power? Can social media be considered a “fourth branch” of power? What are the risks and promises associated with using technology in government? How does this compare to something like the ancient Greek polis’s direct democracy? And how does Big Tech influence democracy – overtly and covertly?

With this post, I aim to explore how this event may influence democracy, and the broader political theory questions these developments provoke.

Discord as Parliament and social media as the fourth branch of power

Until 1990, Nepal had an absolute monarchy, which was overthrown by The People’s Movement, introducing a multiparty parliamentary democracy, but also leading to instability. Because Nepal’s median age is around 30, the culture is dominated by Gen Z (those born between 1997 and 2012), a generation that is made up of digital natives. Thus, when government tried to shut down social media platforms, it was widely seen as a threat to freedom of expression and access to information: things that the youth values significantly.

The election carried out on the gaming platform, Discord shows the power of social media in the democratic process quite clearly. Traditionally, we recognize three branches of government: the legislative, the executive, and the judiciary. The UN described media’s function as “disseminating information and ideas of public interest as it supports informed societies and democratic participation”. Indeed, being a “branch of power” implies that the media sets agendas (decides what issues are discussed), mobilizes people, influences outcomes and has recognized legitimacy. Of these criteria, the last one comes into question most: after all, not every citizen with the right to vote has access to the internet, and there are more fake social media profiles than real ones. This means that not all citizens can participate in elections, undermining public legitimacy. However, we must remember that Nepal only chose an interim leader, to avoid backsliding into anti-democratic patterns, with voting rights still being upheld.

Social media platforms may eventually become an “agora” of social decision-making – maybe not the outright fourth branch of power, but able to substitute the first, legislative branch, in times of crises. This function, however, may flow from a “fourth branch” function, serving as a watchdog over the original three branches and stepping in where necessary.

In addition to insufficient representation, rule of law is also brought into question in a “discord democracy”. Institutionalizing this kind of mobilization, and embedding them into legal and constitutional structures, is challenging, especially because there is a lot of misinformation and disinformation online. Platforms can be hijacked by private or non-state actors, who can fragment or polarize public discourse. Moreover, AI technology can be used to subconsciously nudge citizens into making uninformed or coerced decisions. Platforms’ algorithms also decide what content goes viral and what remains obscure, making it easy to manipulate the outcome of decisions. The accountability of voting is also called into question on online platforms, because there is no foolproof mechanism to oversee the process.

On Big Tech’s Politics

An essential facet of this story is that online social media platforms (such as Discord, TikTok, or Instagram) are owned by large tech companies. While our lives are increasingly shaped by these platforms, there are legal issues when it comes to private and public spheres interacting.

Who decides what content is allowed, what is banned, how moderation is done? When governments try to regulate these issues (in quite different ways), they interact with private entities (Big Tech), operated by a select few who makes decisions affecting entire nations – such as Elon Musk sending and revoking Starlink terminals from Ukraine at will. When tech companies make policy decisions on what speech to permit, and whether to comply with local regulations, they effectively exercise power over speech and political expression, not just facilitating but shaping public debate.

Can voting on Discord be considered direct democracy?

While there are numerous legitimacy and practicality questions associated with democracy exercised through social media, I cannot help but acknowledge that it could ideally fill the gap between direct and indirect elections.

In ancient Athens, direct democracy meant that eligible citizens met (in person) in assemblies, heard speeches, debated, voted, and made decisions themselves directly on laws and policies, not via representatives. There are certain parallels with what happened in Nepal: (a part of) the youth gathered via Discord, debated and eventually selected an interim leader themselves. However, there are important differences. While the Ancient Greek polis had legitimacy (even though only a subset of society had voting rights), Nepal’s Discord polls are mere informal recommendations, with formal constitutional authority remaining with institutional actors. Indeed, bureaucracy is necessary, because modern states are too large for citizens to gather – a thing that is made easier by using online media platforms or virtual reality tools to come together, if not physically, then through the internet.

Aristotle designated polity (polüteia) as the right kind of democracy: governed for the interests of all, not just the leadership. While that might be possible on a modern online platform (public, open group deliberation, and selecting leaders via collective decision), the system lacks formal institutions with legitimate authority.

One of the most vital questions of Nepal’s Discord parliament is whether other nations can follow its example, or even recognize the interim leader as someone with legitimacy, eventually accepting social media platforms as spheres of politics? How can platform-based decisions become state decisions? For example, if every citizen who can vote has a digital ID confirming their identity, and elections are held on a nationally owned and operated digital platform with constitutional rules and strict cybersecurity measures, can that system eventually replace elections? What would be the social ramifications of such reliance on internet access, digitalization, and trust in IT?

As it currently stands, internet access is uneven, and those without it would be excluded from politics. Even members of older generations, who are weaker at understanding digital literacy, online slang, or recognizing deepfakes, could be silenced or ignored in favor of younger people’s take on politics. There is also a fear of becoming increasingly environmentally destructive, as we rely more and more on LLMs and AI agents.

How voting and democracy may change globally

I have no fear of Discord democracy becoming widespread anytime soon, as institutionalization of digital councils, citizen assemblies, online voting or polling is unlikely to become embedded in constitutions. However, it is important to note that the power of digital communities is undeniable. Access to social media became so important that it is viewed by most of Gen Z as a fundamental right, and online communities will play an increasingly vital part in leadership selection, even if just temporarily. We are also seeing more “digitally enabled civic agencies,” where people can self-organize, deliberate, and decide. But technology is a double-edged sword: it amplifies voices but also creates polarization and echo chambers.

If social media is to be considered a new branch of power, it must come with the utmost responsibility, checks and balances, and inclusiveness in mind. Big Tech would undoubtedly be influential in such a world, but they must be balanced by public oversight, law, civil society, and transparency. Should voting – and Parliament itself – ever become digitally driven, we must pay attention to how legitimacy is built, and how permanence is assured.

Consequently, the government collapsed, and the Parliament of Nepal essentially moved to Discord, where more than 100,000 citizens met in a virtual chat room to choose an interim leader to oversee elections scheduled for March 5, 2026. This resulted in Former Supreme Court justice Sushila S Karki being sworn in as Nepal’s interim Prime Minister on September 12, 2025. These dramatic events force us to confront deeper questions: what is democracy when social media becomes central to political power? Can social media be considered a “fourth branch” of power? What are the risks and promises associated with using technology in government? How does this compare to something like the ancient Greek polis’s direct democracy? And how does Big Tech influence democracy – overtly and covertly? With this post, I aim to explore how this event may influence democracy, and the broader political theory questions these developments provoke. Discord as Parliament and social media as the fourth branch of power Until 1990, Nepal had an absolute monarchy, which was overthrown by The People’s Movement, introducing a multiparty parliamentary democracy, but also leading to instability. Because Nepal’s median age is around 30, the culture is dominated by Gen Z (those born between 1997 and 2012), a generation that is made up of digital natives. Thus, when government tried to shut down social media platforms, it was widely seen as a threat to freedom of expression and access to information: things that the youth values significantly. The election carried out on the gaming platform, Discord shows the power of social media in the democratic process quite clearly. Traditionally, we recognize three branches of government: the legislative, the executive, and the judiciary. The UN described media’s function as “disseminating information and ideas of public interest as it supports informed societies and democratic participation”.

The country will hold elections on March 5, 2026, to elect the next government and prime minister. The appointment of the 73-year-old former chief justice makes her the first woman to hold the post.

To recall, the “Gen Z” protests in Nepal initially began as a social media protest against the lifestyles of the “nepo kids”. These took a violent turn once Prime Minister Oli announced a ban on all social media applications that failed to comply with the government’s rules. The uprising was met with firing and tear gas by security forces, who were faced with an increasingly militant uprising that set fire to politicians’ residences and government buildings, including the parliament. At least 51 people were killed and 1,300 were injured as a result, Reuters reported.

The manner of Karki’s appointment has generated curiosity, with protesters flocking to the messaging app Discord to cast an informal vote in her favour. Here is what to know about the platform dubbed “Slack for Gamers” and how the vote unfolded.

Discord’s evolution from a gaming-first to a social platform

Discord is an instant messaging platform with VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol, or simply Internet calling) capabilities, which allows its users to communicate through text messages, voice and video calls, and media sharing. Users may share messages privately through personal messages, or in virtual community chat rooms called “servers”, which are accessible through invitation links.

Founded in 2015 by Jason Citron and Stanislav Vishnevskiy, both founders of social gaming platforms, Discord emerged from Citron’s struggles in the online gaming industry. After limited success with a multiplayer game, he focused on perfecting the chat feature, making it the sole product.

“I think at the time we had maybe six users,” Citron told The New York Times in a 2021 interview. “It wasn’t clear that it was going to work.”

The platform, which counts as its competition Slack and the now-defunct Skype, initially focused on improving its voice technology, even rebuilding the tech three times within the first few months of the application going live. It also allowed its users to assign roles and permissions to different members on their servers, allowing them to moderate and even ban people from the servers.

The platform has steadily grown since, reaching over 200 million monthly users by May 2024. Of these, 90% are gamers, logging 1.5 billion hours playing games. The onset of the Covid pandemic helped Discord diversify into other markets. Even as working adults flocked to Zoom, Discord was favoured by the younger generation to freely socialise, forming and finding communities to discuss subjects

Key Discord features

Despite the intimidating jargon associated with the platform (like servers and channels), the actual user experience on the platform is not as complicated.

Story continues below this ad

01 Access Users may access Discord through the browser or a dedicated mobile or desktop application (from Android to iOS, Windows to MacOS). They may create a unique username and find friends using their usernames. 02 Servers Specialised communities, allowing users to find and form communities (like groups on Facebook, sub-reddits on Reddit) on topics ranging from politics to music, mental health to gaming. 03 Text Channels Specific chat rooms allowing the members to engage in written discussions on a subject. 04 Voice Channels These allow for spoken conversation among the users. However, unlike a typical voice call, a user can enter a voice channel and start conversing as if they were physically present in a room with their peers. There are no issues with hopping in or off a call, unlike a Zoom call, which requires the host to log in for the e-meeting to begin. This has been Discord’s USP. 05 Screen sharing Typically used by gamers to showcase their gameplay, provided they have the requisite permission to do so on a voice channel, and Discord recognises the specific game. During the pandemic, this feature was widely used to enable watch parties on streaming apps. 06 Roles Roles may be assigned to different members in a server. The highest-ranking among these are the moderators or admins who may lay down the guidelines of the server, moderate the content, and even remove non-compliant members. 07 Badges Badges operate like badges or medals in real life. Users on a server may earn specific badges for meeting a certain milestone.

How Nepal leveraged Discord to select the new PM

The current protests have been drastically different from previous waves since they were loosely organised across multiple cities and did not have a single central organising group. All activity was coordinated through social media platforms, including Discord. ABC News Australia reported that the movement was not prepared for a quick outcome.

“This was an organic, decentralised protest across multiple cities — not a centrally organised movement,” 26-year-old protester Bishal Sapkota told ABC Australia. “Frankly, the protesters didn’t expect the government to fall within just two days, so they were somewhat unprepared for this rapid success.”

One Discord server with over 100,000 members became the focal point, watched on Nepalese national TV and livestreamed on news sites. Oli’s resignation on September 9, as well as the removal of the cabinet, created a void that the citizens were eager to fill, and this server was centrestage to the deliberations that followed.

“The Parliament of Nepal right now is Discord,” The NYT quoted Sid Ghimiri, 23, a content creator from Kathmandu, as saying. The server is run by members of Hami Nepal, an NGO that has previously mobilised support during earthquakes, floods, and international relief campaigns.

Any PM candidate needed to be amenable to the country’s military, which exercised de facto control of the country absent a functioning government. The NYT reported that Nepal’s army chiefs met the organisers of the server and tasked them with finding a potential candidate.

“The point was to simulate a kind of mini-election,” Shaswot Lamichhane, a fresh high school graduate and channel moderator who has represented the group in talks with the military, told The NYT. The Discord group did not represent the whole country, and its goal was merely to suggest an interim leader who could oversee elections, he said.

The server swelled to over 145,000 users in four days, and was repeatedly hijacked by trolls and non-Nepalese citizens, making the deliberations a largely chaotic experience.

The members deliberated among several possible candidates, including Nepalese cricketer Sagar Dhakal, and former electricity chief Kul Man Ghising. Eventually, the Discord group arrived at a consensus around Sushila Karki. She secured the most votes in an informal poll on the server, and her name was proposed for meetings with the army.

https://constitutionaldiscourse.com/democracy-in-the-age-of-discord-nepals-gen-z-chooses-leader-through-social-media/,Gen Z’s social media use and global communication,"Generation Z (Gen Z), also named digital natives, is the first to have been born after the mass-adoption of the Internet, especially the social media. Through all kinds of international digital platforms, Gen Z has more access to a vast number of diverse information than previous generations.

Interconnected on world media platforms, Gen Z has become a generation doing Internet-based communication from a young age. Exposed to global communication platforms, especially global social media platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok etc., how Gen Z’s perceptions and attitudes are shaped by online content from all over the world is important to study.

However, either studies about Gen Z’s online media use and their perceptions of another country or comparative studies across countries are scarce. Furthermore, studies focus on Gen Z’s media use in a global context, especially news consumption, is of vital importance to the understanding of the world.

Our journal, OMGC, made some efforts this year to fill this gap. We organized a preconference at the 2023 Annual conference of the International Communication Association (ICA) in Toronto, Canada. In his keynote speech of our preconference titled, “Zoomers, Millennials, Gen X and Boomers? The News Finds Me Perception as a Media Effect Equalizer and Implications on Global Communication,” Homero Gil de Zuniga proposed a model of media use of young people. He argued that in a social media age, Generation Z, instead of searching for news, rely on “news finds me”. In addition, two panels, “Media Use and Gen Z’s World View” and “Children and News: Lessons Learnt and Future Directions” as well as 14 papers with topics such as the effects of social media use and international news on Gen Z’s world view, politics and Gen Z’s media use, artificial intelligence and Gen Z, digital activism and Gen Z, and cross-generational comparisons were presented at the preconference. See our full preconference program at https://omgc.shisu.edu.cn/8e/63/c12420a167523/page.htm.

This themed issue is compiled from six selected revised manuscripts from the preconference. All authors highlighted the importance of social media in Generation Z’s daily lives.

We begin the issue with Diana Alvarez-Macias, Alfredo Villafranca and Carmen Villafranca’s article, “Identity, migration, and social media: Generation Z in USMCA.” It is a cross-national comparison of high school students who are immigrants, second and third generations of immigrants and natives in three major cities in the three member countries of USMCA – United States, Canada and Mexico. In-depth interviews revealed their social media use influenced their own national identity, perceptions of other countries and their interest in migration. Canadians were rated most positively among youths across the three countries. Youths learned about other countries mostly from social media posts of other fellow migrant youths.

Rik Ray’s article, “online news platforms still matter: Generational news consumption patterns during the 2020 presidential election” explores the Gen Z’s political news consumption using a novel quasi-experimental interrupted time series analysis during the 2020 US presidential election. Based on ComScore’s log data of 30,000 national sampled participants which separate social media and news web sites use, he found that major political events did trigger Gen Z’s online news consumption. Even though Gen Z audiences generally spend more time on social media compared to previous generations, all generations’ social media use decreased rather than increased during election time.

Mara Singer, Chaz Callendar, Xiao Ma and Samuel Tham’s article, “Differences in perceived influencer authenticity: A comparison of Gen Z and Millennials definitions of influencer authenticity during the De-Influencer Movement,” uses the six dimensions of authenticity for social media influencers (SMI) to compare Gen Z and Millennials and found they have different authenticity expectations of SMI: Gen Z considers SMIs as highly knowledgeable and trustworthy friends with whom they can seek advice and opinions, while Millennials see SMIs as a profession that needs to be done in an ethical and transparent manner.

Yijin Li’s article, “Why does Gen Z watch Virtual Streaming VTube Anime Videos with Avatars on Twitch?” explores why video game consoles such as Twitch have become U.S. Gen Z’s favorite platform to watch a special type of online content: live streaming anime videos (mostly Japanese) with only narration and no real person appearance.

“From the Traditionalists to Gen Z: Conceptualizing Intergenerational Communication and Media Preferences in the USA” by May Hongmei Gao is an article analyzing the features of communication of five generations from the Traditionalists to Gen Z in the USA by semi-structured in-depth interviews with global business leaders and participant observation. The article proposes a revised taxonomy of generations based on a 15-year period and the media preferences of different generations. Her article discusses the implications of understanding generational differences on effective intergenerational communication in organizations.

Through all kinds of international digital platforms, Gen Z has more access to a vast number of diverse information than previous generations. Interconnected on world media platforms, Gen Z has become a generation doing Internet-based communication from a young age. Exposed to global communication platforms, especially global social media platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok etc., how Gen Z’s perceptions and attitudes are shaped by online content from all over the world is important to study. However, either studies about Gen Z’s online media use and their perceptions of another country or comparative studies across countries are scarce. Furthermore, studies focus on Gen Z’s media use in a global context, especially news consumption, is of vital importance to the understanding of the world. Our journal, OMGC, made some efforts this year to fill this gap. We organized a preconference at the 2023 Annual conference of the International Communication Association (ICA) in Toronto, Canada. In his keynote speech of our preconference titled, “Zoomers, Millennials, Gen X and Boomers? The News Finds Me Perception as a Media Effect Equalizer and Implications on Global Communication,” Homero Gil de Zuniga proposed a model of media use of young people. He argued that in a social media age, Generation Z, instead of searching for news, rely on “news finds me”. In addition, two panels, “Media Use and Gen Z’s World View” and “Children and News: Lessons Learnt and Future Directions” as well as 14 papers with topics such as the effects of social media use and international news on Gen Z’s world view, politics and Gen Z’s media use, artificial intelligence and Gen Z, digital activism and Gen Z, and cross-generational comparisons were presented at the preconference. See our full preconference program at https://omgc.shisu.edu.cn/8e/63/c12420a167523/page.htm. This themed issue is compiled from six selected revised manuscripts from the preconference. All authors highlighted the importance of social media in Generation Z’s daily lives. We begin the issue with Diana Alvarez-Macias, Alfredo Villafranca and Carmen Villafranca’s article, “Identity, migration, and social media: Generation Z in USMCA.” It is a cross-national comparison of high school students who are immigrants, second and third generations of immigrants and natives in three major cities in the three member countries of USMCA – United States, Canada and Mexico. In-depth interviews revealed their social media use influenced their own national identity, perceptions of other countries and their interest in migration. Canadians were rated most positively among youths across the three countries. Youths learned about other countries mostly from social media posts of other fellow migrant youths. Rik Ray’s article, “online news platforms still matter: Generational news consumption patterns during the 2020 presidential election” explores the Gen Z’s political news consumption using a novel quasi-experimental interrupted time series analysis during the 2020 US presidential election. Based on ComScore’s log data of 30,000 national sampled participants which separate social media and news web sites use, he found that major political events did trigger Gen Z’s online news consumption. Even though Gen Z audiences generally spend more time on social media compared to previous generations, all generations’ social media use decreased rather than increased during election time. Mara Singer, Chaz Callendar, Xiao Ma and Samuel Tham’s article, “Differences in perceived influencer authenticity: A comparison of Gen Z and Millennials definitions of influencer authenticity during the De-Influencer Movement,” uses the six dimensions of authenticity for social media influencers (SMI) to compare Gen Z and Millennials and found they have different authenticity expectations of SMI: Gen Z considers SMIs as highly knowledgeable and trustworthy friends with whom they can seek advice and opinions, while Millennials see SMIs as a profession that needs to be done in an ethical and transparent manner. Yijin Li’s article, “Why does Gen Z watch Virtual Streaming VTube Anime Videos with Avatars on Twitch?” explores why video game consoles such as Twitch have become U.S. Gen Z’s favorite platform to watch a special type of online content: live streaming anime videos (mostly Japanese) with only narration and no real person appearance. Using a survey of Reddit users on VTube communities to explore motivations for watching these videos and their gifting behaviors, Li found that companionship, appearance of the avatars, and the personality of VTubers influence viewers’ willingness to watch live streaming and about one-third of the viewers use gifting to express their support of these VTubers.

Document Excerpt

3:1—There is no great share of probity necessary to support a monarchical or despotic government: the force of laws, in one, and the prince’s arm, in the other, are sufficient to direct and maintain the whole: but, in a popular state, one spring more is necessary, namely, virtue. . . .

When virtue is banished, ambition invades the minds of those who are disposed to receive it, and avarice possesses the whole community. . . . The members of the commonwealth riot on the public spoils, and its strength is only the power of a few, and the license of many.

4:5—It is in a republican government that the whole power of education is required. . . . [V]irtue is a self-renunciation, which is very arduous and painful.

This virtue may be defined as the love of the laws and of our country. As such love requires a constant preference of public to private interest, it is the source of all private virtues.

8:16—It is natural for a republic to have a small territory; otherwise it cannot subsist. In an extensive republic there are men of large fortunes, and consequently of less moderation; there are trusts too considerable to be placed on any single subject; he has interests of his own; he soon begins to think that he may be happy and glorious, by oppressing his fellow-citizens; and that he may raise himself to grandeur on the ruins of his country.

In an extensive republic, the public good is sacrificed to a thousand private views: it is subordinate to exceptions, and depends on accidents. In a small one, the interest of the public is more obvious, better understood, and more within the reach of every citizen.

9:1—If a republic be small, it is destroyed by a foreign force; if it be large, it is ruined by an internal imperfection. . . . The evil is in the very thing itself, and no form can redress it.

It is, therefore, very probable that mankind would have been, at length, obliged to live constantly under the government of a single person, had they not contrived a kind of constitution that has all the internal advantages of a republican, together with the external force of a monarchical government. I mean a confederate republic.

11:4—Democratic and aristocratic states are not in their own nature free. Political liberty is to be found only in moderate governments; and even in these it is not always found. It is there only when there is no abuse of power. But constant experience shows us that every man invested with power is apt to abuse it, and to carry his authority as far as it will go. Is it not strange, though true, to say that virtue itself has need of limits?

To prevent this abuse, it is necessary from the very nature of things that power should be a check to power. A government may be so constituted as no man shall be compelled to do things to which the law does not oblige him, nor forced to abstain from things which the law permits.

11:5—Though all governments have the same general end, which is that of preservation, yet each has another particular object. . . . One nation there is . . . in the world that has for the direct end of its constitution political liberty. We shall presently explain the principles on which this liberty is founded . . . .

11.6.—In every government there are three sorts of power: the legislative; the executive in respect to things dependent on the law of nations; and the executive in regard to matters that depend on the civil law.

By virtue of the first, the prince or magistrate enacts temporary or perpetual laws, and amends or abrogates those that have been already enacted. By the second, he makes peace or war, sends or receives embassies, establishes the public security, and provides against invasions. By the third, he punishes criminals, or determines the disputes that arise between individuals. The latter we shall call the judiciary power, and the other simply the executive power of the state.

The political liberty of the subject is a tranquility of mind arising from the opinion each person has of his safety. In order to have this liberty, it is requisite the government be so constituted as one man need not be afraid of another.

When the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person, or in the same body of magistrates, there can be no liberty; because apprehensions may arise, lest the same monarch or senate should enact tyrannical laws, to execute them in a tyrannical manner.

Again, there is no liberty, if the judiciary power be not separated from the legislative and executive. Were it joined with the legislative, the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary control; for the judge would be then the legislator. Were it joined to the executive power, the judge might behave with violence and oppression.

There would be an end of everything, were the same man or the same body, whether of the nobles or of the people, to exercise those three powers, that of enacting laws, that of executing the public resolutions, and of trying the causes of individuals.

15:1—Slavery, properly so called is the establishment of a right which gives to one man such a power over another as renders him absolute master of his life and fortune. The state of slavery is in its own nature bad. It is neither useful to the master nor to the slave; not to the slave, because he can do nothing through a motive of virtue; nor to the master, because by having an unlimited authority over his slaves he insensibly accustoms himself to the want of all moral virtues, and thence becomes fierce, hasty, severe, choleric, voluptuous, and cruel.

19:27—I have spoken in the eleventh book of a free people, and have given the principles of their constitution: let us now see the effects, which follow from this liberty, the character it is capable of forming, and the customs which naturally result from it. . . . .

As there are in this state two visible powers—the legislative and executive—and as every citizen has a will of his own and may at pleasure assert his independence, most men have a greater fondness for one of these powers than for the other, and the multitude have commonly neither equity nor sense enough to show an equal affection to both.

And as the executive power, by disposing of all employments, may give greater hopes, and no fears, every man who obtains any favor from it is ready to espouse its cause; while it is liable to be attacked by those who have nothing to hope from it.

All the passions being unrestrained, hatred, envy, jealousy, and an ambitious desire of riches and honors, appear in their extent; were it otherwise, the state would be in the condition of a man weakened by sickness, who is without passions because he is without strength.

The hatred which arises between the two parties will always subsist, because it will be impotent.

These parties being composed of freemen, if the one becomes too powerful for the other, as a consequence of liberty the other is depressed; while the citizens take the weaker side, with the same readiness as the hands lend their assistance to remove the infirmities and disorders of the body.

Every individual is independent, and being commonly led by caprice and humor, frequently changes parties; he abandons one where he left all his friends, to unite himself to another in which he finds all his enemies: so that in this nation it frequently happens that the people forget the laws of friendship, as well as those of hatred. . . .

This nation is passionately fond of liberty, because this liberty is real; and it is possible for it, in its defence, to sacrifice its wealth, its ease, its interest, and to support the burden of the heaviest taxes, even such as a despotic prince durst not lay upon his subjects.

If this nation sends colonies abroad, it must rather be to extend its commerce than its dominion.

As men are fond of introducing into other places what they have established amongst themselves, they have given the people of the colonies their own form of government; and this government carrying prosperity along with it, they have raised great nations in the forests they were sent to inhabit.",https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/historic-document-library/detail/montesquieuthe-spirit-of-the-laws-1748,,"Charles-Louis de Secondat, baron de la Brède et de Montesquieu (1689-1755) was the author of the Persian Letters (1721), Considerations on the Causes of the Greatness of the Romans and of their Decline (1733), and of The Spirit of the Laws (1748).

Introduction

On May 13, 2022, Elon Musk suspended his planned purchase of Twitter Inc. ‘pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users’ (Musk, 2022a). His tweet included a link to a news article on the recent Twitter filing, in which the company estimated spam and fake accounts comprised less than 5% of users. Almost two months later, on July 8, lawyers acting for Musk wrote to Twitter saying that Musk was terminating his offer to buy the company, claiming that despite his efforts, Twitter had ‘failed or refused to provide’ sufficient information about false accounts for him to make an adequate assessment of their prevalence (Ringler, 2022).

Critics of Musk’s deal quickly wrote off this rationale as an excuse to renegotiate his original offer or find a way out (Fontanella-Khan & Murphy, 2022). Whether or not this is true, Musk’s apprehensiveness reflected widespread and long held concerns about the proportion of Twitter profiles that are not authentic users (Ferrara et al., 2016). Nor are these concerns limited to Twitter. All the major social media platforms acknowledge that a proportion of their user bases are bots, spam or false accounts. When these companies were young these inauthentic accounts were considered relatively inconsequential. Now that they are among the most valuable and influential companies in the world, the European Commission terms them the ‘gatekeepers’ of the virtual world and new laws seek to minimise the harms they cause, there is a need to reconsider the importance of these false accounts (Digital Markets Act, 2020; Online Safety Bill, 2022). Not only is this information, as Elon Musk’s lawyers wrote, fundamental to the ‘business and financial performance’ of social media companies like Twitter, it is also core to the prevailing business model of the internet (digital advertising), and these inauthentic accounts are purported to be the source of co-ordinated abuse, amplification and influence operations (Twitter Safety, 2020; Gleicher et al., 2021). Yet, as Twitter’s responses to the calls made by Elon Musk showed, even the companies themselves do not appear to know their full nature or the extent to which they are prevalent.

This article seeks to understand why so little is known about the nature and extent of these ‘false or spam accounts’ across the leading social media companies, why this lack of knowledge is even greater outside the companies themselves and the implications of this epistemic uncertainty. It concludes that authorities, investors and the public should not be solely reliant on the companies for user account figures, and that there is a need for regular, independent, external audits of inauthentic accounts on social media. The first section of the article considers how much major social media companies appear to know about the number of fake accounts on their services (based on public statements and reporting). The next section assesses why social media companies themselves do not appear to know the full extent of false accounts on their services. The article then examines why external observers have found it harder still to assess the nature and scale of different profile types, before considering the consequences of fake accounts and of persistent epistemic uncertainty. It concludes by outlining the need for future auditing and research, noting the relative absence of any requirements for the auditing of user accounts within current platform policy initiatives.

It is important to note that despite the normative implications of the terminology, ‘false’, ‘fake’, ‘spam’ or ‘bot’ profiles on social media are not necessarily a problem, and in many instances may provide positive benefits. Having multiple social media profiles allows people to avoid ‘context collapse’ and take on different roles or personas so they can perform different functions in different aspects of their lives (Marwick & boyd, 2011). Many social bots perform useful and productive tasks, and have the potential to do more (e.g. Hofeditz et al., 2019). Yet, as this article will illustrate, the number of these profiles and the epistemic uncertainty about them, creates political, social and economic problems, which if not addressed, will make the resolution of other negative externalities associated with social media even more difficult.

Methodologically, the article adopts a mixed methods approach, necessary due to the multifarious sources of information about social media profiles, and because of the extensive gaps in our current knowledge. It benefits from extensive computer science literature, particularly on bots, though it does not employ computer science methods. Rather, it uses evidence produced by the major social media companies themselves (including corporate reports, statements, filings and public posts), supplemented by industry surveys, journalistic investigations and internet archival research (via archive.org and the Zuckerberg Files). To contextualise the research and better understand the perspectives of the social media companies, a series of 30-60 minute, targeted, in-person interviews were conducted – mostly via video conference – with the relevant representatives from Twitter and Meta, as well as with researchers who have sought to identify specific categories of inauthentic social media users and the uses to which these profiles are employed (see Appendix for details). This research is contextualised when appropriate. In addition, a systematic literature review was conducted, understood as “a systematic, explicit, and reproducible method for identifying, evaluating, and synthesizing the existing body of completed and recorded work produced by researchers, scholars, and practitioners” (Fink, 2010) to identify the research to date on inauthentic social media users.

The article employs terminology used by the companies themselves, though recognises that this terminology can be both ambiguous and can encourage misleading normative assumptions. Calling accounts ‘fake’, ‘false’ or ‘spam’, as the companies do, makes them appear deceptive and perfidious, even though their definition was originally driven by economic, rather than ethical considerations (to distinguish monetizable from non-monetizable users). In order to group these terms together, and again build on the language used by the companies, this article will refer to inauthentic accounts or profiles, while again recognizing the insufficiency of this term due, in part, to epistemic uncertainty about the nature of these accounts.

Estimated proportion of inauthentic accounts on leading social media services

Since the leading social media companies have gone public and been required to report on their users, they have acknowledged that a proportion of their users are not directly associated with a single individual person. In 2012, Facebook admitted that around 83 million of their active users – equivalent to the population of Germany – were ‘duplicate’ or ‘false’ (Facebook Inc., 2012). After 2012 the proportion of duplicate and false users on the service rose, according to Facebook, from 7-9% of users to 13-14% by 2017 (Facebook Inc., 2017). Given how quickly the absolute number of Facebook users also grew in the period, this equated to about 260 million duplicate and false profiles in 2017. The following year Facebook reported that the number of these users rose again, to approximately 16%, where it remained in 2019 and 2020. In 2020, therefore, Facebook reported that 448 million accounts on its platform were duplicate or false. It did not record or report the figure for Instagram, whose users were reported to have reached one billion in 2018 (Stern, personal communication, 25 June, 2021).

Twitter also provides approximate figures for the proportion of false, spam or automated accounts in its Securities filings. In its 2013 Annual Report the company ‘estimated that false or spam accounts represented less than 5% of our MAUs’ (Twitter Inc., 2013, p. 2). This figure was differentiated from 11% of active users who use ‘applications that automatically contact our servers for regular updates with no user action involved’ (Twitter Inc., 2013, p. 2). It was not made clear whether these proportions overlapped or were complementary, nor whether the second figure applied exclusively to automated accounts. The following year the annual report repeated the 5% figure, with the same caveats, though reduced the 11% to 8.5% (Twitter Inc., 2014, p. 4). The 5% and 8.5% figures were then repeated, word-for-word, in the annual reports for fiscal years ending December 2015, 2016 and 2017 (Twitter Inc., 2016; 2017; 2018). Twitter stopped reporting the second figure from 2018, though continued to repeat the 5% figure (now for mDAU). Other social media services, such as Snap and LinkedIn, also admit to having duplicate, multiple or inauthentic users on their platforms, though do not provide numbers for them (Snap Inc., 2021a, p. 4; LinkedIn Inc., 2016, p. 18).

Each of the leading global social media services, therefore, admits that a proportion of the profiles on its service are spam, fake or duplicate. Though, as will be illustrated below, the actual number of these inauthentic accounts, and what makes them inauthentic, remains far from clear.

Acknowledgement of epistemic uncertainty

The companies partially admit their inability to identify inauthentic users, and that their figures are guesstimates that could be wildly off. Each year since Facebook began reporting publicly on its users in 2012, it has set out the same caveat: ‘there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world’ (Facebook Inc., 2012-2020). Every year Facebook explains that it estimated the number of duplicate or false users based on ‘an internal review of a limited sample of accounts’, and that it applied ‘significant judgment in making this determination’ (Facebook Inc., 2012-2020). ‘Duplicate and false accounts’, the company acknowledged in 2018, ‘are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate and false accounts may vary significantly from our estimates’ (Facebook Inc., 2018, p. 4). In 2020, after Facebook introduced its ‘Family metrics’ to measure users across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, it extended these caveats further, saying that ‘it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins’ (Facebook Inc., 2020, p. 5).

Twitter employs almost the same language as Facebook when providing warnings around its user figures. ‘There are’, it has said since 2013, ‘inherent challenges in measuring usage and user engagement across our large user base around the world’, and ‘In making this determination [as to the proportion of inauthentic users], we applied significant judgment, so our estimation of false or spam accounts may not accurately represent the actual number of such accounts, and the actual number of false or spam accounts could be higher than we have estimated’ (Twitter Inc., 2013, p. 30). This uncertainty may be due to the method used to calculate inauthentic accounts. According to Elon Musk, Twitter uses a random sample of only 100 Twitter profiles to calculate the proportion of fake/spam/duplicate accounts (Musk, 2022b).

Other leading US social media services do not even try to estimate the actual number of inauthentic accounts on their service: ‘there may’, Snap stated, ‘be individuals who have unauthorized or multiple Snapchat accounts… We have not determined the number of such multiple accounts’ (Snap Inc., 2021a, p. 4). Instagram provides no information about the number of inauthentic users. This paper identifies three main reasons for this epistemic uncertainty: inconsistent definition of ‘user’ and ‘false/fake’, limited user verification and incomplete or irreconcilable calculations.

Causes of epistemic uncertainty

Inconsistent definition of ‘user’ and ‘false/fake’

The political economy of a social media service is driven by its ‘users’. Users are the metric that defines social media companies’ performance for investors, that generate their income from advertisers, that determine the content and connections they promote and drive the future development of their services. As the Facebook 2020 annual report states: ‘The size of our user base and our users' level of engagement are critical to our success’ (Facebook Inc., 2020, p. 13). Hence why, since they have gone public, each of the leading social media companies have explained how they calculate and enumerate their users at the start of annual reports. ‘The numbers of our monthly active users (MAUs), daily active users (DAUs), mobile MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU)’ Facebook set out in its first report in 2012, ‘are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts’ (Facebook Inc., 2012, p. 4). Similarly, Twitter set out an analogous approach to its ‘users’ the following year, and explained how fundamental these metrics are to its business: ‘We review a number of metrics, including monthly active users, or MAUs, timeline views, timeline views per MAU and advertising revenue per timeline view, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions’ (Twitter Inc., 2013, p. 2). ‘User’ is the lingua franca of social media companies. Facebook employs the term ‘user’ 339 times, on average, in each of its annual reports between 2012 and 2020.

Despite the cross-industry reliance on the term ‘user’, there is an inconsistency, both across and within social media companies, about the definition of the term. For Facebook, users are ‘unique people’ and ‘the individual people behind user accounts’ who must use ‘the same name that you use in everyday life’ and ‘Provide accurate information about yourself’ (Facebook Inc., 2020). A duplicate account, an account created for a ‘non-human entity’, or one that is being used in ways that violate terms of service, all represent invalid Facebook users. At Facebook’s sister service Instagram, however, the definition of a valid user is broader. Although its Terms of Service state that ‘you’ cannot impersonate someone on Instagram, or create an automated account, you do not have to give your actual name (Instagram, 2021). Similarly, at Snapchat, ‘you’ are (by implication, if not explicitly) a person, though you do not have to use your real name or provide accurate information, and you will not - as at Instagram – ‘create more than one account for yourself’ (Snap Inc., 2021b). By contrast, Twitter allows a single account holder to have multiple accounts, allows automated accounts, and accounts held by non-human entities.

The lack of a consistent industry definition of what represents a social media ‘user’ complicates the task of differentiating between types of account, and identifying which accounts should be considered authentic or inauthentic. This does not mean that such a definition is impossible, or that user types cannot be identified. Various academic studies have pointed to the ambiguity of terms like user, and called for universal measures of user behaviour (Obar & Wildman, 2015; Trifiro & Gerson, 2019). Other research has differentiated between active and inactive users – or so-called ‘lurkers’, in order to distinguish between the accounts of those who simply observe rather than post (Tagarelli & Interdonato, 2013).

On the basis of a review of existing literature, this paper proposes a basic typology of social media profiles composed of four types: alter egos (manually controlled accounts operated by the person with which they are associated – by either a real name or pseudonym), social bots (‘a computer algorithm that automatically produces content and interacts with humans on social media’, Ferrara et al., 2016), sybils (manually controlled accounts deliberately dissociated from the person operating them – sometimes referred to as sockpuppets or catfish), and digital ghosts (the social media profiles that persist online after people have died, and are sometimes memorialised or reactivated for posthumous use). Most of the focus to date has been on social bots (a term sometimes used indiscriminately with fake accounts), even though these represent a smaller proportion than the other categories. According to one recent study, for example, the number of digital ghosts on Facebook is already voluminous and will likely outnumber the living within fifty years (Öhman & Watson, 2019). For the purposes of this paper, any profile that is not manually operated by the person directly associated with that profile — an alter ego in the typology above — will be considered inauthentic.

Limited user verification

Since social media companies were established they have required minimal information or verification. The most successful early social media services, Friendster (2003), MySpace (2003), Bebo (2005) and LinkedIn (2002), all simply asked for a name and an email address, as can been seen from their early registration pages (Appendix). Facebook (2004) initially distinguished itself by restricting membership to US university students, starting with its founder’s own, Harvard. At that point, Mark Zuckerberg said, ‘it’s just immediately obvious to you’ when a profile is fake (Stanford University, 2005). Yet, when Facebook opened to the public in 2006, despite keeping to its real name policy, it only required a name, an email address, a password and a date of birth, in addition to a captcha to screen bots (Appendix). Twitter (2006) initially asked users to register with a mobile phone number, but quickly dropped this and adopted what had, by late 2006, become the norm in social media – registration simply via name and email (Appendix). The norm was driven by the competitive need to sign up as many users as possible, as Steven Levy wrote of Facebook’s Open Reg, ‘expanding to everyone was the mission’ (Levy, 2020, p. 120).

As a consequence of these low hurdles for registration and verification, many of the accounts created in the early years were not directly associated with an individual living person (for example duplicate profiles) or to a human being at all (organisations, pets or bots). Within four days of Twitter launching, for example, developers had already started openly publishing code for the creation of Twitter bots, and in the eight years from 2008-16 the number of Twitter bot repositories on just one publicly available developer website — GitHub — grew to over 4,000 (Kollanyi, 2016). ‘Fakesters’ were an integral part of Friendster from its inception, and MySpace was found to suffer from ‘the rampant use of false profiles’ (boyd, 2004; Gehl, 2012). Even Facebook, despite its real name policy, was accused of having, by 2008, ‘a nation's worth of fake accounts’ (Lanier, 2008). Although the hurdles for account creation have risen, it is still straightforward to create a new profile.

Incomplete or irreconcilable calculations

Although the major social media companies release figures about the number of false or fake accounts, the way these figures are calculated does not identify all the potential false or fake profiles. Similarly, the extent of inauthentic profiles reported in the annual filings does not correlate with other reported figures or activities.

Since Q4 2017 Facebook has been releasing data on ‘fake accounts actioned’ each quarter. The average for the 14 quarters up to Q1 2021 was 1.3 billion (this does not include fake accounts blocked immediately after creation) and a total of 17.6 billion, or over six times the total number of monthly Facebook users, created in 3.5 years (Facebook Inc., 2021). Of these, Facebook claimed that it identified, on average, 99.5% before they were flagged by users themselves (Facebook Inc., 2021). However, as Facebook acknowledged during personal communication for this article, this figure is simply an addition of the fake accounts identified by Facebook with the fake accounts flagged by users (Stern, personal communication, 25 June, 2021). It does not show the number of ‘fake accounts’ that Facebook has failed to identify, or that its users have not flagged. Nor does it give any breakdown of the type of ‘fake accounts’ created or their impact. In 2019 Facebook acknowledged that its reporting of fake accounts was not very illuminating, and that it was ‘evaluating if there is a better way to report on fake accounts in future’ (Schultz, 2019).

Twitter has a similar issue with false account creation, if on a lesser absolute scale. In May 2018, the company reported they were identifying ‘more than 9.9 million potentially spammy or automated accounts per week’ (Roth & Harvey, 2018). Yet, despite the identification of over four times as many spam or automated accounts that year (515m) as Twitter’s daily active user base (122m), and not accounting for additional potential inauthentic accounts, the company reported that the proportion of false or spam accounts remained exactly the same, at below 5% year-on-year. Similarly, the proportion of false or spam accounts that are reported does not change following Twitter’s periodic largescale culls of false or spam accounts. In the nine months preceding May 2018, for example, it challenged more than 50 million accounts, ranging from around 2.5 million some months, to 10 million in others (Roth & Harvey, 2018). In 2020 Twitter responded to growing concerns about the influence of bots on its platform, accepting that there was general confusion about their extent and effect, for which Twitter itself was partly responsible. However, rather than seeking to clarify their extent, Twitter asserted that identifying bots was complex — ‘It’s not just a binary question of bot or not’ — and that it was better to focus on behaviour, and the ‘malicious use of automation’ (Roth & Pickles, 2020). While this approach may be pragmatic, it shifts the burden of responsibility from the identification of inauthentic profiles to malevolent behaviour on the platform, making any action necessarily reactive.

External research on social media bots

Outside these companies, external researchers have sought to identify, characterise and enumerate certain categories of inauthentic user, most notably automated accounts on Twitter (Oentaryo et al., 2016; Romanov et al., 2017; Gorwa & Guilbeault, 2020; Orabi et al., 2020). Using supervised machine learning techniques and an extensive training data set, in 2017 Varol et al. classified ‘a sample of millions of English-speaking active [Twitter] users’ and found that 9-15% were likely to be bots: a figure significantly higher than Twitter’s annual estimate of below 5% (Varol et al., 2017). Other studies that have sought to quantify the extent and impact of Twitter bots have focused on particular issues or events, and found that during any one political event, there can be tens of thousands of active bots (Thomas et al., 2012, Luceri et al., 2019; Bastos & Mercea, 2019), and there are instances — such as the US 2016 election — where many more have been estimated (Bessi & Ferrara, 2016).

Separate research shows that most social bots do not focus overtly on political issues or events. When Keller and Klinger analysed the increase in bot accounts during the 2017 German electoral campaigns, from 7.1% to 9.9%, they found that only between 1-2% of the increase could be defined as political (Keller & Klinger, 2019). Bence Kollanyi’s analysis of thousands of Twitter bot repositories on GitHub between 2008 and 2016 found only 1% made direct reference to politics (Kollanyi, 2016). Other research suggests that there may be vast numbers of bots tweeting about non-political issues. Echeverria and Zhou came across a Star Wars bot network, ‘consisting of more than 350,000 bots tweeting random quotations exclusively from Star Wars novels’ (Echeverria & Zhou, 2017). A network of prayer bots, virtually unknown outside the Middle East before 2017, far surpasses this number. A single Islamic prayer app in the network of bots (Du3a.org) accounted for approximately 1.9 million tweets per day, greatly exceeding the estimated number of US election tweets posted by bots in the lead up to November 2016 (Öhman et al., 2019). These glimpses into huge Twitter bot networks that exist far beyond the limits of political debate is indicative of how little we know from outside observation about their total number and proportion.

Even extensive research on Twitter bots demonstrates how challenging it is to identify bots accurately, comprehensively and consistently. This is in part due to the ‘ground truth’ dilemma (Gorwa & Guilbeault, 2020; Yang et al., 2019). A researcher cannot be sure they have identified the right bots, or all bots, if there is no master list defining which Twitter accounts are real users, and which are not. Even if a researcher discovers a network of a thousand Twitter accounts they think are bots, they may not be able to verify they are bots, nor confirm they are the only bots out there. In 2015 a DARPA Twitter Bot Challenge, six teams successfully identified pro-vaccination bots from a set of 7,000 Twitter accounts (Subrahmanian et al., 2016; Subrahmanian, personal communication, 9 June, 2020). However, the teams were analysing a controlled data set of 7,000 accounts, not the 320 million monthly active users on Twitter. Not only are social media platforms much bigger, but they are constantly evolving (Luceri et al., 2019). A Twitter user might start as a human and then become a bot. Or a human user might supplement their own tweets with automated tweets. Or a human might tweet like a bot (Gilani et al., 2017). Similarly, any two bot developers will create bots that function differently. Finding criteria that successfully identify certain bots (such as number of tweets per day) may fail to identify other bots. Moreover, as an outside observer, it is only possible to analyse Twitter accounts by their activity. Unless they tweet, they are essentially invisible. There could be millions of dormant Twitter accounts – sleeper profiles – just waiting to be activated for a purpose as yet unknown, as was discovered in Russia in 2011, and the US in 2018 (Thomas et al., 2012; Takacs & McCulloh, 2019).

Limited research on inauthentic accounts beyond Twitter

External research on inauthentic accounts has necessarily been constrained by the amount of information made available by the social media companies (Driscoll & Walker, 2014). Since low-bandwidth text-based information is easily and publicly available from Twitter, in contrast with Facebook and YouTube, for example, Twitter has by far attracted the most academic attention. This is borne out by a systematic literature review conducted for this article. 414 relevant academic journal articles, conference articles and chapters dating from 2009 to 2020 were identified based on keyword searches of SCOPUS, ProQuest and Google scholar, using the terms ‘social media’, ‘bots’, ‘fake accounts’, ‘false accounts’ or ‘inauthentic’ accounts. Of these 414, 333 sought to identify, characterise, analyse or measure the impact of social media bots or false accounts (as opposed to testing chatbots or identifying botnets not particular to social media). Of these 333 articles, 77% (258) were wholly or primarily based on Twitter. Of the remainder, 15 articles (4.5%) analysed automated or false profiles on Facebook or Instagram. Although the focus on Twitter is understandable given data limitations, it means most research is focused on a service that is less than a tenth of the scale of Facebook. Moreover, the focus has not only been on Twitter, but on Twitter bots, as opposed to non-automated accounts. Of the 258 articles focused on Twitter, 64% were about Twitter bots.

The limited research that has been done on the authenticity of profiles beyond Twitter, within and outside the academia, has found evidence to suggest that the figures the companies publish may be inaccurate, and that the number of bought, stolen and manufactured profiles is extensive. In 2018, for example, a number of advertisers started a class action suit against Facebook, asserting that they had found that in certain regions and amongst certain demographics, the number of Facebook profiles far exceeded the actual number of people (based on census numbers), sometimes by a factor of 400% (Singer and Project Therapy v Facebook Inc., 2018). Separately, external researchers have discovered a thriving open market in social media accounts, some of which are stolen, others which are manufactured for sale (Bay & Fredheim, 2019). Studying the 2019 market in social media manipulation, researchers working with NATO StratCom were struck not only by the scale and sophistication of the market in profiles, but by its openness (Bay and Fredheim, personal communication, 11 May, 2020). If these profiles were not inauthentic prior to their sale, then they were subsequent to their sale (it should be noted that the StratCom research was conducted for the purposes of informing the strategic communications capabilities of NATO).

Moreover, the figures published by the major social media platforms do not include sybils or digital ghosts, each of which may be extensive (Öhman & Watson, 2019). Therefore, from the limited internal and external figures that exist, there appear to be significantly more profiles on each major social media service than actual people on the services. However, rather than calling these services overpopulated, with its normative implications, this additional social media population would better be termed ‘hyper-population’. In this context the term ‘hyper’ has three meanings that are distinct from ‘over’ -population. It indicates that this population exists not (just) in physical space, but in cyberspace, corresponding to Jean Baudrillard’s use of the term ‘hyperreal’ — ‘transferring it [human space] into a hyperreal of simulation’ (Baudrillard, 1995, p. 82). It points to the ephemerality and insubstantiality of these additional social media users, whose association with actual, living individuals is precarious and will vary by profile and over dimensions of time and space (boyd, 2007). As such, the normative implications are distinct from those associated with overpopulation. It also signifies that the number of inauthentic users on social media may be much greater than has been reported to date.

Consequences of social media hyper-population and epistemic uncertainty

The consequences of social media hyper-population are not necessarily negative. As discussed above, inauthentic profiles can be beneficial to society, or simply immaterial to the functioning of the platform. Islamic prayer bots appear to be becoming a common part of Muslim culture (Öhman et al., 2019). The majority of social media profiles of people who have died accrete, but for the most part lie inactive and undisturbed. However, there are also problems associated with hyper-population and epistemic uncertainty about the nature and extent of inauthentic profiles.

The first issue concerns the value and business model of the companies themselves. As Elon Musk’s lawyers wrote, ‘Twitter’s true mDAU count is a key component of the company’s business, given that approximately 90% of its revenue comes from advertisements’ (Ringler, 2022). The same holds true for all other major social media companies that rely on advertising for most of their income. Moreover, since much of the information economy on the web is based around attention, epistemic uncertainty about the authenticity of attention risks undermining the wider political economy of the internet. If advertisers come to believe that a large proportion of the attention and response they pay for is not real, then social media hyper-population may precipitate a ‘subprime attention crisis’ (Hwang, 2020). The accurate identification of inauthentic accounts is also a prerequisite to addressing the increasing problem of fraud online. False social media accounts have been found to have been used extensively to commit fraud, launch attacks and commit various financially motivated crimes online. The overall extent of this is significant and growing. In digital advertising, for example, the annual cost of fraud has been estimated at between $6.5 and $19 billion (Perrin, 2019). Other analyses have found that 28-40% of web traffic and clicks appear to be non-human, and used for the purpose of generating revenue from manufactured attention (Gordon et al., 2021).

In politics, social bots, sybils and compromised user accounts are used to manipulate issues and events. Since Facebook began reporting on ‘inauthentic behavior’ on its services, it has removed thousands of Facebook and Instagram accounts which it says were being used to ‘manipulate public debate’ in over 40 countries (Facebook Inc., 2018-2021). Former Facebook employee and whistleblower Sophie Zhang claimed in a 2020 internal memo, and subsequently in an interview for this article, that this represents only a fraction of the inauthentic political activity (Silverman & Mac, 2020; Zhang, personal communication, 7 May, 2021). Other investigations and research appear to corroborate Zhang’s claims. In 2019, for example, hired trolls ‘worked round-the-clock to flood platforms such as Twitter and Facebook with seemingly organic messages of support’ for a Senate candidate in the Philippines (Mahtani & Cabato, 2019). In the months leading up to the European Parliamentary elections in May 2019, false and suspect Facebook accounts were used to promote the far right AfD party (Davis et al., 2019). Networks of false profiles have been used to disseminate extremist propaganda in Germany (Baumgärtner & Höfner, 2020). Political consultancies have used false accounts to leak allegations about politicians and pose as local campaigners, such as the Israeli company the Archimedes Group, which was active across north and west Africa (Gleicher, 2019). Other public affairs companies have used such accounts to promote state propaganda (Davies, 2019). In each of these cases false accounts appear to have played a part in the distortion and manipulation of political issues or events, and the amalgamation of manufactured and genuine support, though there remains considerable uncertainty about the nature of the role they played.

Candidates and campaigns also hire or buy fake followers and engagement to give a false impression of popularity or representativeness. Estimates of the proportion of @realDonaldTrump followers who were false, for example, ranged from 3% to over 60% (McGill, 2016; Fishkin, 2018). In the lead up to the US 2016 Presidential election, a subsection of these bots linked to Russia retweeted @realDonaldTrump 469,527 times (Twitter Inc. Submission, 2019). In 2018 the Office of the New York State Attorney General estimated that up to 9.6 million comments lodged with the FCC regarding planned changes to net neutrality rules ‘wrongfully used New Yorkers’ identities without their consent’ (James, 2018). Some of the identities used were those of people who had died (Singer-Vine & Collier, 2019). In Austria, a PR Agency called Mhoch3, employed people to post 80-100,000 comments per year under false online identities on behalf of institutional clients, including State-owned rail and bus companies (Apfl & Kleiner, 2014). Public support has, particularly in democratic societies, been seen as a justification for political action. Yet, if this public support is fabricated, or is perceived to be fabricated, then there is no such democratic justification.

The accumulation of additional social media accounts has also been associated with social problems. In some studies, users who are anonymous, or whose account is not linked to a single identifiable individual, have been found to be more aggressive, and less likely to observe netiquette than profiles linked directly to a real author (Moore et al., 2012). Though other studies do not find such a link and point out that anonymity is a ‘multifaceted construct’ (Jaidka et al., 2022). Bots and sybils have been used for harassment and abuse (Ferrara, 2015), to amplify low-credibility content (Shao et al., 2018) and to post false reviews online (Competition and Markets Authority, 2021). Celebrities and commentators have been found to have artificially inflated their followers and engagements (Confessore et al., 2018). Even police have used false Facebook profiles to impersonate real people (Maass, 2019).

There is also a wider danger posed by social media hyper-population and epistemic uncertainty about the nature and extent of inauthentic profiles: the deterioration of public trust. Trust in the content of social media is already low, and will decline further if people believe that many of the users, and much of the engagement, is manufactured or counterfeit. Few people feel expert at assessing the authenticity of individuals online. A 2018 Pew Research Study found that only 7% of American adults were very confident they could recognize bots on social media, with 40% somewhat confident, and 53% not very or not at all confident (Stocking & Sumida, 2018). The public’s lack of confidence regarding bots is coupled with their growing concern about bots online, and a perception that bots are a malignant influence (Stocking & Sumida, 2018). Left unaddressed, epistemic uncertainty could make social media look like a systemically untrustworthy space in which people are unsure who or what is real.

Conclusion

This article has shown that, though the leading social media companies recognise that a proportion of their users are inauthentic (in the sense of fake, spam or duplicate accounts), there is considerable uncertainty about the exact nature or number of these accounts. It has outlined three of the reasons for this uncertainty: the inconsistent definition of ‘user’, the low hurdles to account creation, and incomplete or irreconcilable calculations by social media companies. It has also sought to show how difficult it is for external observers to research the nature and extent of different user types, even on a platform as open and accessible as Twitter. For these reasons, there is limited existing knowledge about the number or type of inauthentic accounts on leading social media services. The figures that are available, and the research that has been done, suggest that the number of inauthentic accounts may be considerably different than the figures reported. These inauthentic accounts can, as this article also outlines, be the source of negative economic, political and social consequences. Though, due to epistemic uncertainty it is not possible to evaluate the degree to which they are the cause, or properly assess the impact they have.

The article therefore concludes that there is a need for detailed, consistent and assessable audits of the nature and extent of inauthentic accounts on major social media services. The companies claim, in their Securities’ filings, that they already conduct such audits. Yet, as this article has sought to demonstrate, these audits are not sufficiently detailed, are inconsistent and are not properly assessable. Moreover, there are reasons to question the figures reported. There is therefore a compelling rationale for these audits to be conducted by an independent external body, and in such a way that they can be scrutinised by those outside the companies themselves. Similar independent audits have been proposed or conducted for digital intermediary algorithms, and for content moderation (Digital Regulation Cooperation Forum, 2022; Sarang, 2022).

Social media account audits are unlikely to result from current social media legislative initiatives in Europe and the US. These initiatives are directed chiefly at regulating content rather than users. Legislation passed or tabled, by the EU and the UK, to address online harms focuses on the sufficiency of intermediary processes for dealing with harmful content. Although both the EU’s Digital Services Act (2020) and the UK’s Online Safety Bill (2022) require risk assessments of platform services, there is no obligation to audit or enumerate social media accounts. The Digital Services Act (DSA) comes closest, in recognising that there may be particular risks associated with ‘the creation of fake accounts, the use of bots, and other automated or partially automated behaviours’, and requiring platforms to mitigate against such risks (Digital Services Act, 2020). Yet, the transparency requirements within the DSA, as with the transparency requirements contained within a raft of draft proposals put forward at the State and Federal level in the US (such as the Platform Accountability and Consumer Transparency Act [S.797], or the Platform Accountability and Transparency Act) have yet to specify transparency about the number or type of user accounts. For this reason, epistemic uncertainty about inauthentic accounts may not be resolved by current policy initiatives.

There is also a pressing need for further academic research on inauthentic accounts. This research will need to go beyond Twitter, where most research attention has been focused to date, to examine inauthentic accounts on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and other leading services. It will need to document who is creating inauthentic accounts, what accounts they are creating, how many accounts are they creating and for what purpose. Equally, there is a need for research that analyses the accounts that are used to pursue coordinated inauthentic behaviour, in order to understand which accounts are being used for malignant or fraudulent purposes. This research will necessitate greater openness from the companies than we have seen to date, reiterating the need for further policy intervention.

Fake accounts on social media, epistemic uncertainty and the need for an independent auditing of accounts. Internet Policy Review, 12(1). https://doi.org/10.14763/2023.1.1680 Introduction On May 13, 2022, Elon Musk suspended his planned purchase of Twitter Inc. ‘pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users’ (Musk, 2022a). His tweet included a link to a news article on the recent Twitter filing, in which the company estimated spam and fake accounts comprised less than 5% of users. Almost two months later, on July 8, lawyers acting for Musk wrote to Twitter saying that Musk was terminating his offer to buy the company, claiming that despite his efforts, Twitter had ‘failed or refused to provide’ sufficient information about false accounts for him to make an adequate assessment of their prevalence (Ringler, 2022). Critics of Musk’s deal quickly wrote off this rationale as an excuse to renegotiate his original offer or find a way out (Fontanella-Khan & Murphy, 2022). Whether or not this is true, Musk’s apprehensiveness reflected widespread and long held concerns about the proportion of Twitter profiles that are not authentic users (Ferrara et al., 2016). Nor are these concerns limited to Twitter. All the major social media platforms acknowledge that a proportion of their user bases are bots, spam or false accounts. When these companies were young these inauthentic accounts were considered relatively inconsequential. Now that they are among the most valuable and influential companies in the world, the European Commission terms them the ‘gatekeepers’ of the virtual world and new laws seek to minimise the harms they cause, there is a need to reconsider the importance of these false accounts (Digital Markets Act, 2020; Online Safety Bill, 2022). Not only is this information, as Elon Musk’s lawyers wrote, fundamental to the ‘business and financial performance’ of social media companies like Twitter, it is also core to the prevailing business model of the internet (digital advertising), and these inauthentic accounts are purported to be the source of co-ordinated abuse, amplification and influence operations (Twitter Safety, 2020; Gleicher et al., 2021). Yet, as Twitter’s responses to the calls made by Elon Musk showed, even the companies themselves do not appear to know their full nature or the extent to which they are prevalent. This article seeks to understand why so little is known about the nature and extent of these ‘false or spam accounts’ across the leading social media companies, why this lack of knowledge is even greater outside the companies themselves and the implications of this epistemic uncertainty. It concludes that authorities, investors and the public should not be solely reliant on the companies for user account figures, and that there is a need for regular, independent, external audits of inauthentic accounts on social media. The first section of the article considers how much major social media companies appear to know about the number of fake accounts on their services (based on public statements and reporting). The next section assesses why social media companies themselves do not appear to know the full extent of false accounts on their services. The article then examines why external observers have found it harder still to assess the nature and scale of different profile types, before considering the consequences of fake accounts and of persistent epistemic uncertainty. It concludes by outlining the need for future auditing and research, noting the relative absence of any requirements for the auditing of user accounts within current platform policy initiatives. It is important to note that despite the normative implications of the terminology, ‘false’, ‘fake’, ‘spam’ or ‘bot’ profiles on social media are not necessarily a problem, and in many instances may provide positive benefits. Having multiple social media profiles allows people to avoid ‘context collapse’ and take on different roles or personas so they can perform different functions in different aspects of their lives (Marwick & boyd, 2011). Many social bots perform useful and productive tasks, and have the potential to do more (e.g. Hofeditz et al., 2019). Yet, as this article will illustrate, the number of these profiles and the epistemic uncertainty about them, creates political, social and economic problems, which if not addressed, will make the resolution of other negative externalities associated with social media even more difficult. Methodologically, the article adopts a mixed methods approach, necessary due to the multifarious sources of information about social media profiles, and because of the extensive gaps in our current knowledge. It benefits from extensive computer science literature, particularly on bots, though it does not employ computer science methods. Rather, it uses evidence produced by the major social media companies themselves (including corporate reports, statements, filings and public posts), supplemented by industry surveys, journalistic investigations and internet archival research (via archive.org and the Zuckerberg Files). To contextualise the research and better understand the perspectives of the social media companies, a series of 30-60 minute, targeted, in-person interviews were conducted – mostly via video conference – with the relevant representatives from Twitter and Meta, as well as with researchers who have sought to identify specific categories of inauthentic social media users and the uses to which these profiles are employed (see Appendix for details). This research is contextualised when appropriate. In addition, a systematic literature review was conducted, understood as “a systematic, explicit, and reproducible method for identifying, evaluating, and synthesizing the existing body of completed and recorded work produced by researchers, scholars, and practitioners” (Fink, 2010) to identify the research to date on inauthentic social media users. The article employs terminology used by the companies themselves, though recognises that this terminology can be both ambiguous and can encourage misleading normative assumptions. Calling accounts ‘fake’, ‘false’ or ‘spam’, as the companies do, makes them appear deceptive and perfidious, even though their definition was originally driven by economic, rather than ethical considerations (to distinguish monetizable from non-monetizable users). In order to group these terms together, and again build on the language used by the companies, this article will refer to inauthentic accounts or profiles, while again recognizing the insufficiency of this term due, in part, to epistemic uncertainty about the nature of these accounts. Estimated proportion of inauthentic accounts on leading social media services Since the leading social media companies have gone public and been required to report on their users, they have acknowledged that a proportion of their users are not directly associated with a single individual person. In 2012, Facebook admitted that around 83 million of their active users – equivalent to the population of Germany – were ‘duplicate’ or ‘false’ (Facebook Inc., 2012). After 2012 the proportion of duplicate and false users on the service rose, according to Facebook, from 7-9% of users to 13-14% by 2017 (Facebook Inc., 2017). Given how quickly the absolute number of Facebook users also grew in the period, this equated to about 260 million duplicate and false profiles in 2017. The following year Facebook reported that the number of these users rose again, to approximately 16%, where it remained in 2019 and 2020. In 2020, therefore, Facebook reported that 448 million accounts on its platform were duplicate or false. It did not record or report the figure for Instagram, whose users were reported to have reached one billion in 2018 (Stern, personal communication, 25 June, 2021). Twitter also provides approximate figures for the proportion of false, spam or automated accounts in its Securities filings. In its 2013 Annual Report the company ‘estimated that false or spam accounts represented less than 5% of our MAUs’ (Twitter Inc., 2013, p. 2). This figure was differentiated from 11% of active users who use ‘applications that automatically contact our servers for regular updates with no user action involved’ (Twitter Inc., 2013, p. 2). It was not made clear whether these proportions overlapped or were complementary, nor whether the second figure applied exclusively to automated accounts. The following year the annual report repeated the 5% figure, with the same caveats, though reduced the 11% to 8.5% (Twitter Inc., 2014, p. 4). The 5% and 8.5% figures were then repeated, word-for-word, in the annual reports for fiscal years ending December 2015, 2016 and 2017 (Twitter Inc., 2016; 2017; 2018). Twitter stopped reporting the second figure from 2018, though continued to repeat the 5% figure (now for mDAU). Other social media services, such as Snap and LinkedIn, also admit to having duplicate, multiple or inauthentic users on their platforms, though do not provide numbers for them (Snap Inc., 2021a, p. 4; LinkedIn Inc., 2016, p. 18). Each of the leading global social media services, therefore, admits that a proportion of the profiles on its service are spam, fake or duplicate. Though, as will be illustrated below, the actual number of these inauthentic accounts, and what makes them inauthentic, remains far from clear. Acknowledgement of epistemic uncertainty The companies partially admit their inability to identify inauthentic users, and that their figures are guesstimates that could be wildly off. Each year since Facebook began reporting publicly on its users in 2012, it has set out the same caveat: ‘there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world’ (Facebook Inc., 2012-2020). Every year Facebook explains that it estimated the number of duplicate or false users based on ‘an internal review of a limited sample of accounts’, and that it applied ‘significant judgment in making this determination’ (Facebook Inc., 2012-2020). ‘Duplicate and false accounts’, the company acknowledged in 2018, ‘are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate and false accounts may vary significantly from our estimates’ (Facebook Inc., 2018, p. 4). In 2020, after Facebook introduced its ‘Family metrics’ to measure users across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, it extended these caveats further, saying that ‘it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins’ (Facebook Inc., 2020, p. 5). Twitter employs almost the same language as Facebook when providing warnings around its user figures. ‘There are’, it has said since 2013, ‘inherent challenges in measuring usage and user engagement across our large user base around the world’, and ‘In making this determination [as to the proportion of inauthentic users], we applied significant judgment, so our estimation of false or spam accounts may not accurately represent the actual number of such accounts, and the actual number of false or spam accounts could be higher than we have estimated’ (Twitter Inc., 2013, p. 30). This uncertainty may be due to the method used to calculate inauthentic accounts. According to Elon Musk, Twitter uses a random sample of only 100 Twitter profiles to calculate the proportion of fake/spam/duplicate accounts (Musk, 2022b). Other leading US social media services do not even try to estimate the actual number of inauthentic accounts on their service: ‘there may’, Snap stated, ‘be individuals who have unauthorized or multiple Snapchat accounts… We have not determined the number of such multiple accounts’ (Snap Inc., 2021a, p. 4). Instagram provides no information about the number of inauthentic users. This paper identifies three main reasons for this epistemic uncertainty: inconsistent definition of ‘user’ and ‘false/fake’, limited user verification and incomplete or irreconcilable calculations. Causes of epistemic uncertainty Inconsistent definition of ‘user’ and ‘false/fake’ The political economy of a social media service is driven by its ‘users’. Users are the metric that defines social media companies’ performance for investors, that generate their income from advertisers, that determine the content and connections they promote and drive the future development of their services. As the Facebook 2020 annual report states: ‘The size of our user base and our users' level of engagement are critical to our success’ (Facebook Inc., 2020, p. 13). Hence why, since they have gone public, each of the leading social media companies have explained how they calculate and enumerate their users at the start of annual reports. ‘The numbers of our monthly active users (MAUs), daily active users (DAUs), mobile MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU)’ Facebook set out in its first report in 2012, ‘are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts’ (Facebook Inc., 2012, p. 4). Similarly, Twitter set out an analogous approach to its ‘users’ the following year, and explained how fundamental these metrics are to its business: ‘We review a number of metrics, including monthly active users, or MAUs, timeline views, timeline views per MAU and advertising revenue per timeline view, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions’ (Twitter Inc., 2013, p. 2). ‘User’ is the lingua franca of social media companies. Facebook employs the term ‘user’ 339 times, on average, in each of its annual reports between 2012 and 2020. Despite the cross-industry reliance on the term ‘user’, there is an inconsistency, both across and within social media companies, about the definition of the term. For Facebook, users are ‘unique people’ and ‘the individual people behind user accounts’ who must use ‘the same name that you use in everyday life’ and ‘Provide accurate information about yourself’ (Facebook Inc., 2020). A duplicate account, an account created for a ‘non-human entity’, or one that is being used in ways that violate terms of service, all represent invalid Facebook users. At Facebook’s sister service Instagram, however, the definition of a valid user is broader. Although its Terms of Service state that ‘you’ cannot impersonate someone on Instagram, or create an automated account, you do not have to give your actual name (Instagram, 2021). Similarly, at Snapchat, ‘you’ are (by implication, if not explicitly) a person, though you do not have to use your real name or provide accurate information, and you will not - as at Instagram – ‘create more than one account for yourself’ (Snap Inc., 2021b). By contrast, Twitter allows a single account holder to have multiple accounts, allows automated accounts, and accounts held by non-human entities. The lack of a consistent industry definition of what represents a social media ‘user’ complicates the task of differentiating between types of account, and identifying which accounts should be considered authentic or inauthentic. This does not mean that such a definition is impossible, or that user types cannot be identified. Various academic studies have pointed to the ambiguity of terms like user, and called for universal measures of user behaviour (Obar & Wildman, 2015; Trifiro & Gerson, 2019). Other research has differentiated between active and inactive users – or so-called ‘lurkers’, in order to distinguish between the accounts of those who simply observe rather than post (Tagarelli & Interdonato, 2013). On the basis of a review of existing literature, this paper proposes a basic typology of social media profiles composed of four types: alter egos (manually controlled accounts operated by the person with which they are associated – by either a real name or pseudonym), social bots (‘a computer algorithm that automatically produces content and interacts with humans on social media’, Ferrara et al., 2016), sybils (manually controlled accounts deliberately dissociated from the person operating them – sometimes referred to as sockpuppets or catfish), and digital ghosts (the social media profiles that persist online after people have died, and are sometimes memorialised or reactivated for posthumous use). Most of the focus to date has been on social bots (a term sometimes used indiscriminately with fake accounts), even though these represent a smaller proportion than the other categories. According to one recent study, for example, the number of digital ghosts on Facebook is already voluminous and will likely outnumber the living within fifty years (Öhman & Watson, 2019). For the purposes of this paper, any profile that is not manually operated by the person directly associated with that profile — an alter ego in the typology above — will be considered inauthentic. Limited user verification Since social media companies were established they have required minimal information or verification. The most successful early social media services, Friendster (2003), MySpace (2003), Bebo (2005) and LinkedIn (2002), all simply asked for a name and an email address, as can been seen from their early registration pages (Appendix). Facebook (2004) initially distinguished itself by restricting membership to US university students, starting with its founder’s own, Harvard. At that point, Mark Zuckerberg said, ‘it’s just immediately obvious to you’ when a profile is fake (Stanford University, 2005). Yet, when Facebook opened to the public in 2006, despite keeping to its real name policy, it only required a name, an email address, a password and a date of birth, in addition to a captcha to screen bots (Appendix). Twitter (2006) initially asked users to register with a mobile phone number, but quickly dropped this and adopted what had, by late 2006, become the norm in social media – registration simply via name and email (Appendix). The norm was driven by the competitive need to sign up as many users as possible, as Steven Levy wrote of Facebook’s Open Reg, ‘expanding to everyone was the mission’ (Levy, 2020, p. 120). As a consequence of these low hurdles for registration and verification, many of the accounts created in the early years were not directly associated with an individual living person (for example duplicate profiles) or to a human being at all (organisations, pets or bots). Within four days of Twitter launching, for example, developers had already started openly publishing code for the creation of Twitter bots, and in the eight years from 2008-16 the number of Twitter bot repositories on just one publicly available developer website — GitHub — grew to over 4,000 (Kollanyi, 2016). ‘Fakesters’ were an integral part of Friendster from its inception, and MySpace was found to suffer from ‘the rampant use of false profiles’ (boyd, 2004; Gehl, 2012). Even Facebook, despite its real name policy, was accused of having, by 2008, ‘a nation's worth of fake accounts’ (Lanier, 2008). Although the hurdles for account creation have risen, it is still straightforward to create a new profile. Incomplete or irreconcilable calculations Although the major social media companies release figures about the number of false or fake accounts, the way these figures are calculated does not identify all the potential false or fake profiles. Similarly, the extent of inauthentic profiles reported in the annual filings does not correlate with other reported figures or activities. Since Q4 2017 Facebook has been releasing data on ‘fake accounts actioned’ each quarter. The average for the 14 quarters up to Q1 2021 was 1.3 billion (this does not include fake accounts blocked immediately after creation) and a total of 17.6 billion, or over six times the total number of monthly Facebook users, created in 3.5 years (Facebook Inc., 2021). Of these, Facebook claimed that it identified, on average, 99.5% before they were flagged by users themselves (Facebook Inc., 2021). However, as Facebook acknowledged during personal communication for this article, this figure is simply an addition of the fake accounts identified by Facebook with the fake accounts flagged by users (Stern, personal communication, 25 June, 2021). It does not show the number of ‘fake accounts’ that Facebook has failed to identify, or that its users have not flagged. Nor does it give any breakdown of the type of ‘fake accounts’ created or their impact. In 2019 Facebook acknowledged that its reporting of fake accounts was not very illuminating, and that it was ‘evaluating if there is a better way to report on fake accounts in future’ (Schultz, 2019). Twitter has a similar issue with false account creation, if on a lesser absolute scale. In May 2018, the company reported they were identifying ‘more than 9.9 million potentially spammy or automated accounts per week’ (Roth & Harvey, 2018). Yet, despite the identification of over four times as many spam or automated accounts that year (515m) as Twitter’s daily active user base (122m), and not accounting for additional potential inauthentic accounts, the company reported that the proportion of false or spam accounts remained exactly the same, at below 5% year-on-year. Similarly, the proportion of false or spam accounts that are reported does not change following Twitter’s periodic largescale culls of false or spam accounts. In the nine months preceding May 2018, for example, it challenged more than 50 million accounts, ranging from around 2.5 million some months, to 10 million in others (Roth & Harvey, 2018). In 2020 Twitter responded to growing concerns about the influence of bots on its platform, accepting that there was general confusion about their extent and effect, for which Twitter itself was partly responsible. However, rather than seeking to clarify their extent, Twitter asserted that identifying bots was complex — ‘It’s not just a binary question of bot or not’ — and that it was better to focus on behaviour, and the ‘malicious use of automation’ (Roth & Pickles, 2020). While this approach may be pragmatic, it shifts the burden of responsibility from the identification of inauthentic profiles to malevolent behaviour on the platform, making any action necessarily reactive. External research on social media bots Outside these companies, external researchers have sought to identify, characterise and enumerate certain categories of inauthentic user, most notably automated accounts on Twitter (Oentaryo et al., 2016; Romanov et al., 2017; Gorwa & Guilbeault, 2020; Orabi et al., 2020). Using supervised machine learning techniques and an extensive training data set, in 2017 Varol et al. classified ‘a sample of millions of English-speaking active [Twitter] users’ and found that 9-15% were likely to be bots: a figure significantly higher than Twitter’s annual estimate of below 5% (Varol et al., 2017). Other studies that have sought to quantify the extent and impact of Twitter bots have focused on particular issues or events, and found that during any one political event, there can be tens of thousands of active bots (Thomas et al., 2012, Luceri et al., 2019; Bastos & Mercea, 2019), and there are instances — such as the US 2016 election — where many more have been estimated (Bessi & Ferrara, 2016). Separate research shows that most social bots do not focus overtly on political issues or events. When Keller and Klinger analysed the increase in bot accounts during the 2017 German electoral campaigns, from 7.1% to 9.9%, they found that only between 1-2% of the increase could be defined as political (Keller & Klinger, 2019). Bence Kollanyi’s analysis of thousands of Twitter bot repositories on GitHub between 2008 and 2016 found only 1% made direct reference to politics (Kollanyi, 2016). Other research suggests that there may be vast numbers of bots tweeting about non-political issues. Echeverria and Zhou came across a Star Wars bot network, ‘consisting of more than 350,000 bots tweeting random quotations exclusively from Star Wars novels’ (Echeverria & Zhou, 2017). A network of prayer bots, virtually unknown outside the Middle East before 2017, far surpasses this number. A single Islamic prayer app in the network of bots (Du3a.org) accounted for approximately 1.9 million tweets per day, greatly exceeding the estimated number of US election tweets posted by bots in the lead up to November 2016 (Öhman et al., 2019). These glimpses into huge Twitter bot networks that exist far beyond the limits of political debate is indicative of how little we know from outside observation about their total number and proportion. Even extensive research on Twitter bots demonstrates how challenging it is to identify bots accurately, comprehensively and consistently. This is in part due to the ‘ground truth’ dilemma (Gorwa & Guilbeault, 2020; Yang et al., 2019). A researcher cannot be sure they have identified the right bots, or all bots, if there is no master list defining which Twitter accounts are real users, and which are not. Even if a researcher discovers a network of a thousand Twitter accounts they think are bots, they may not be able to verify they are bots, nor confirm they are the only bots out there. In 2015 a DARPA Twitter Bot Challenge, six teams successfully identified pro-vaccination bots from a set of 7,000 Twitter accounts (Subrahmanian et al., 2016; Subrahmanian, personal communication, 9 June, 2020). However, the teams were analysing a controlled data set of 7,000 accounts, not the 320 million monthly active users on Twitter. Not only are social media platforms much bigger, but they are constantly evolving (Luceri et al., 2019). A Twitter user might start as a human and then become a bot. Or a human user might supplement their own tweets with automated tweets. Or a human might tweet like a bot (Gilani et al., 2017). Similarly, any two bot developers will create bots that function differently. Finding criteria that successfully identify certain bots (such as number of tweets per day) may fail to identify other bots. Moreover, as an outside observer, it is only possible to analyse Twitter accounts by their activity. Unless they tweet, they are essentially invisible. There could be millions of dormant Twitter accounts – sleeper profiles – just waiting to be activated for a purpose as yet unknown, as was discovered in Russia in 2011, and the US in 2018 (Thomas et al., 2012; Takacs & McCulloh, 2019). Limited research on inauthentic accounts beyond Twitter External research on inauthentic accounts has necessarily been constrained by the amount of information made available by the social media companies (Driscoll & Walker, 2014). Since low-bandwidth text-based information is easily and publicly available from Twitter, in contrast with Facebook and YouTube, for example, Twitter has by far attracted the most academic attention. This is borne out by a systematic literature review conducted for this article. 414 relevant academic journal articles, conference articles and chapters dating from 2009 to 2020 were identified based on keyword searches of SCOPUS, ProQuest and Google scholar, using the terms ‘social media’, ‘bots’, ‘fake accounts’, ‘false accounts’ or ‘inauthentic’ accounts. Of these 414, 333 sought to identify, characterise, analyse or measure the impact of social media bots or false accounts (as opposed to testing chatbots or identifying botnets not particular to social media). Of these 333 articles, 77% (258) were wholly or primarily based on Twitter. Of the remainder, 15 articles (4.5%) analysed automated or false profiles on Facebook or Instagram. Although the focus on Twitter is understandable given data limitations, it means most research is focused on a service that is less than a tenth of the scale of Facebook. Moreover, the focus has not only been on Twitter, but on Twitter bots, as opposed to non-automated accounts. Of the 258 articles focused on Twitter, 64% were about Twitter bots. The limited research that has been done on the authenticity of profiles beyond Twitter, within and outside the academia, has found evidence to suggest that the figures the companies publish may be inaccurate, and that the number of bought, stolen and manufactured profiles is extensive. In 2018, for example, a number of advertisers started a class action suit against Facebook, asserting that they had found that in certain regions and amongst certain demographics, the number of Facebook profiles far exceeded the actual number of people (based on census numbers), sometimes by a factor of 400% (Singer and Project Therapy v Facebook Inc., 2018). Separately, external researchers have discovered a thriving open market in social media accounts, some of which are stolen, others which are manufactured for sale (Bay & Fredheim, 2019). Studying the 2019 market in social media manipulation, researchers working with NATO StratCom were struck not only by the scale and sophistication of the market in profiles, but by its openness (Bay and Fredheim, personal communication, 11 May, 2020). If these profiles were not inauthentic prior to their sale, then they were subsequent to their sale (it should be noted that the StratCom research was conducted for the purposes of informing the strategic communications capabilities of NATO). Moreover, the figures published by the major social media platforms do not include sybils or digital ghosts, each of which may be extensive (Öhman & Watson, 2019). Therefore, from the limited internal and external figures that exist, there appear to be significantly more profiles on each major social media service than actual people on the services. However, rather than calling these services overpopulated, with its normative implications, this additional social media population would better be termed ‘hyper-population’. In this context the term ‘hyper’ has three meanings that are distinct from ‘over’ -population. It indicates that this population exists not (just) in physical space, but in cyberspace, corresponding to Jean Baudrillard’s use of the term ‘hyperreal’ — ‘transferring it [human space] into a hyperreal of simulation’ (Baudrillard, 1995, p. 82). It points to the ephemerality and insubstantiality of these additional social media users, whose association with actual, living individuals is precarious and will vary by profile and over dimensions of time and space (boyd, 2007). As such, the normative implications are distinct from those associated with overpopulation. It also signifies that the number of inauthentic users on social media may be much greater than has been reported to date. Consequences of social media hyper-population and epistemic uncertainty The consequences of social media hyper-population are not necessarily negative. As discussed above, inauthentic profiles can be beneficial to society, or simply immaterial to the functioning of the platform. Islamic prayer bots appear to be becoming a common part of Muslim culture (Öhman et al., 2019). The majority of social media profiles of people who have died accrete, but for the most part lie inactive and undisturbed. However, there are also problems associated with hyper-population and epistemic uncertainty about the nature and extent of inauthentic profiles. The first issue concerns the value and business model of the companies themselves. As Elon Musk’s lawyers wrote, ‘Twitter’s true mDAU count is a key component of the company’s business, given that approximately 90% of its revenue comes from advertisements’ (Ringler, 2022). The same holds true for all other major social media companies that rely on advertising for most of their income. Moreover, since much of the information economy on the web is based around attention, epistemic uncertainty about the authenticity of attention risks undermining the wider political economy of the internet. If advertisers come to believe that a large proportion of the attention and response they pay for is not real, then social media hyper-population may precipitate a ‘subprime attention crisis’ (Hwang, 2020). The accurate identification of inauthentic accounts is also a prerequisite to addressing the increasing problem of fraud online. False social media accounts have been found to have been used extensively to commit fraud, launch attacks and commit various financially motivated crimes online. The overall extent of this is significant and growing. In digital advertising, for example, the annual cost of fraud has been estimated at between $6.5 and $19 billion (Perrin, 2019). Other analyses have found that 28-40% of web traffic and clicks appear to be non-human, and used for the purpose of generating revenue from manufactured attention (Gordon et al., 2021). In politics, social bots, sybils and compromised user accounts are used to manipulate issues and events. Since Facebook began reporting on ‘inauthentic behavior’ on its services, it has removed thousands of Facebook and Instagram accounts which it says were being used to ‘manipulate public debate’ in over 40 countries (Facebook Inc., 2018-2021). Former Facebook employee and whistleblower Sophie Zhang claimed in a 2020 internal memo, and subsequently in an interview for this article, that this represents only a fraction of the inauthentic political activity (Silverman & Mac, 2020; Zhang, personal communication, 7 May, 2021). Other investigations and research appear to corroborate Zhang’s claims. In 2019, for example, hired trolls ‘worked round-the-clock to flood platforms such as Twitter and Facebook with seemingly organic messages of support’ for a Senate candidate in the Philippines (Mahtani & Cabato, 2019). In the months leading up to the European Parliamentary elections in May 2019, false and suspect Facebook accounts were used to promote the far right AfD party (Davis et al., 2019). Networks of false profiles have been used to disseminate extremist propaganda in Germany (Baumgärtner & Höfner, 2020). Political consultancies have used false accounts to leak allegations about politicians and pose as local campaigners, such as the Israeli company the Archimedes Group, which was active across north and west Africa (Gleicher, 2019). Other public affairs companies have used such accounts to promote state propaganda (Davies, 2019). In each of these cases false accounts appear to have played a part in the distortion and manipulation of political issues or events, and the amalgamation of manufactured and genuine support, though there remains considerable uncertainty about the nature of the role they played. Candidates and campaigns also hire or buy fake followers and engagement to give a false impression of popularity or representativeness. Estimates of the proportion of @realDonaldTrump followers who were false, for example, ranged from 3% to over 60% (McGill, 2016; Fishkin, 2018). In the lead up to the US 2016 Presidential election, a subsection of these bots linked to Russia retweeted @realDonaldTrump 469,527 times (Twitter Inc. Submission, 2019). In 2018 the Office of the New York State Attorney General estimated that up to 9.6 million comments lodged with the FCC regarding planned changes to net neutrality rules ‘wrongfully used New Yorkers’ identities without their consent’ (James, 2018). Some of the identities used were those of people who had died (Singer-Vine & Collier, 2019). In Austria, a PR Agency called Mhoch3, employed people to post 80-100,000 comments per year under false online identities on behalf of institutional clients, including State-owned rail and bus companies (Apfl & Kleiner, 2014). Public support has, particularly in democratic societies, been seen as a justification for political action. Yet, if this public support is fabricated, or is perceived to be fabricated, then there is no such democratic justification. The accumulation of additional social media accounts has also been associated with social problems. In some studies, users who are anonymous, or whose account is not linked to a single identifiable individual, have been found to be more aggressive, and less likely to observe netiquette than profiles linked directly to a real author (Moore et al., 2012). Though other studies do not find such a link and point out that anonymity is a ‘multifaceted construct’ (Jaidka et al., 2022). Bots and sybils have been used for harassment and abuse (Ferrara, 2015), to amplify low-credibility content (Shao et al., 2018) and to post false reviews online (Competition and Markets Authority, 2021). Celebrities and commentators have been found to have artificially inflated their followers and engagements (Confessore et al., 2018). Even police have used false Facebook profiles to impersonate real people (Maass, 2019). There is also a wider danger posed by social media hyper-population and epistemic uncertainty about the nature and extent of inauthentic profiles: the deterioration of public trust. Trust in the content of social media is already low, and will decline further if people believe that many of the users, and much of the engagement, is manufactured or counterfeit. Few people feel expert at assessing the authenticity of individuals online. A 2018 Pew Research Study found that only 7% of American adults were very confident they could recognize bots on social media, with 40% somewhat confident, and 53% not very or not at all confident (Stocking & Sumida, 2018). The public’s lack of confidence regarding bots is coupled with their growing concern about bots online, and a perception that bots are a malignant influence (Stocking & Sumida, 2018). Left unaddressed, epistemic uncertainty could make social media look like a systemically untrustworthy space in which people are unsure who or what is real. Conclusion This article has shown that, though the leading social media companies recognise that a proportion of their users are inauthentic (in the sense of fake, spam or duplicate accounts), there is considerable uncertainty about the exact nature or number of these accounts. It has outlined three of the reasons for this uncertainty: the inconsistent definition of ‘user’, the low hurdles to account creation, and incomplete or irreconcilable calculations by social media companies. It has also sought to show how difficult it is for external observers to research the nature and extent of different user types, even on a platform as open and accessible as Twitter. For these reasons, there is limited existing knowledge about the number or type of inauthentic accounts on leading social media services. The figures that are available, and the research that has been done, suggest that the number of inauthentic accounts may be considerably different than the figures reported. These inauthentic accounts can, as this article also outlines, be the source of negative economic, political and social consequences. Though, due to epistemic uncertainty it is not possible to evaluate the degree to which they are the cause, or properly assess the impact they have. The article therefore concludes that there is a need for detailed, consistent and assessable audits of the nature and extent of inauthentic accounts on major social media services. The companies claim, in their Securities’ filings, that they already conduct such audits. Yet, as this article has sought to demonstrate, these audits are not sufficiently detailed, are inconsistent and are not properly assessable. Moreover, there are reasons to question the figures reported. There is therefore a compelling rationale for these audits to be conducted by an independent external body, and in such a way that they can be scrutinised by those outside the companies themselves. Similar independent audits have been proposed or conducted for digital intermediary algorithms, and for content moderation (Digital Regulation Cooperation Forum, 2022; Sarang, 2022). Social media account audits are unlikely to result from current social media legislative initiatives in Europe and the US. These initiatives are directed chiefly at regulating content rather than users. Legislation passed or tabled, by the EU and the UK, to address online harms focuses on the sufficiency of intermediary processes for dealing with harmful content. Although both the EU’s Digital Services Act (2020) and the UK’s Online Safety Bill (2022) require risk assessments of platform services, there is no obligation to audit or enumerate social media accounts. The Digital Services Act (DSA) comes closest, in recognising that there may be particular risks associated with ‘the creation of fake accounts, the use of bots, and other automated or partially automated behaviours’, and requiring platforms to mitigate against such risks (Digital Services Act, 2020). Yet, the transparency requirements within the DSA, as with the transparency requirements contained within a raft of draft proposals put forward at the State and Federal level in the US (such as the Platform Accountability and Consumer Transparency Act [S.797], or the Platform Accountability and Transparency Act) have yet to specify transparency about the number or type of user accounts. For this reason, epistemic uncertainty about inauthentic accounts may not be resolved by current policy initiatives. There is also a pressing need for further academic research on inauthentic accounts. This research will need to go beyond Twitter, where most research attention has been focused to date, to examine inauthentic accounts on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and other leading services. It will need to document who is creating inauthentic accounts, what accounts they are creating, how many accounts are they creating and for what purpose. Equally, there is a need for research that analyses the accounts that are used to pursue coordinated inauthentic behaviour, in order to understand which accounts are being used for malignant or fraudulent purposes. This research will necessitate greater openness from the companies than we have seen to date, reiterating the need for further policy intervention. References Apfl, S., & Kleiner, S.

Governments, public relations firms and political parties are producing misinformation on an industrial scale, according to the report. It shows disinformation has become a common strategy, with more than 93% of the countries (76 out of 81) seeing disinformation deployed as part of political communication.

Social media manipulation of public opinion is a growing threat to democracies around the world

Professor Philip Howard, Director of the Oxford Internet Institute, and the report’s co-author says, ‘Our report shows misinformation has become more professionalised and is now produced on an industrial scale. Now, more than ever, the public needs to be able to rely on trustworthy information about government policy and activity. Social media companies need to raise their game by increasing their efforts to flag misinformation and close fake accounts without the need for government intervention, so the public has access to high-quality information.’

The OII team warns the level of social media manipulation has soared, with governments and political parties spending millions on private sector ‘cyber troops’, who drown out other voices on social media. Citizen influencers are used to spread manipulated messages. These include volunteers, youth groups and civil society organisations, who support their ideologies.

OII alumna, Dr Samantha Bradshaw, the report’s lead author says, ‘Our 2020 report highlights the way in which government agencies, political parties and private firms continue to use social media to spread political propaganda, polluting the digital information ecosystem and suppressing freedom of speech and freedom of the press. A large part of this activity has become professionalised, with private firms offering disinformation-for-hire services.’

Key findings the OII researchers identified include:

Private ‘strategic communications’ firms are playing an increasing role in spreading computational propaganda, with researchers identifying state actors working with such firms in 48 countries.

Almost $60 million has been spent on firms who use bots and other amplification strategies to create the impression of trending political messaging.

Social media has become a major battleground, with firms such as Facebook and Twitter taking steps to combat ‘cyber troops’, with some $10 million has been spent on social media political advertisements. The platforms removed more than 317,000 accounts and pages from ‘cyber troops’ actors between January 2019 and November 2020.

This activity has become professionalised, with private firms offering disinformation-for-hire services Dr Samantha Bradshaw

Cyber troops are frequently directly linked to state agencies. According to the report, ‘In 62 countries, we found evidence of a government agency using computational propaganda to shape public attitudes.’

Established political parties were also found to be using social media to ‘spread disinformation, suppress political participation, and undermine oppositional parties’, say the Oxford researchers.

According to the report, ‘In 61 countries, we found evidence of political parties or politicians running for office who have used the tools and techniques of computational propaganda as part of their political campaigns. Indeed, social media has become a critical component of digital campaigning.’

Dr Bradshaw adds, ‘Cyber troop activity can look different in democracies compared to authoritarian regimes. Electoral authorities need to consider the broader ecosystem of disinformation and computational propaganda, including private firms and paid influencers, who are increasingly prominent actors in this space.’

The report explores the tools and techniques of computational propaganda, including the use of fake accounts – bots, humans and hacked accounts – to spread disinformation. It finds:

79 countries used human accounts,

57 counties used bot accounts, and

14 countries used hacked or stolen accounts.

Researchers examined how cyber troops use different communication strategies to manipulate public opinion, such as creating disinformation or manipulated media, data-driven targeting and employing abusive strategies such as mounting smear campaigns or online harassment. The report finds:

76 countries used disinformation and media manipulation as part of their campaigns,

30 countries used data-drive strategies to target specific users with political advertisements,

59 countries used state sponsored trolls to attack political opponents or activists in 2019, up from 47 countries in 2019.

The 2020 report draws upon a four-step methodology employed by Oxford researchers to identify evidence of globally organised manipulation campaigns. This includes a systematic content analysis of news articles on cyber troop activity, a secondary literature review of public archives and scientific reports, generating country specific case studies and expert consultations.

Within the current digital environment online platforms are information structures that hold the role of information intermediaries, or even “gatekeepers”, among their users. What if a similar approach, that of an informational structure, was applied onto states as well? How would that affect their role under traditional state theory?

The ‘States-as-Platforms’ Approach

Under the current EU law approach, online platforms essentially “store and disseminate to the public information” (DSA, article 2). This broadly corresponds to the digital environment around us, accurately describing a service familiar to us all whereby an intermediary offers to the public an informational infrastructure (a “platform”) that stores data uploaded by a user and then, at the request of that same user, makes such data available to a wider audience, be it a closed circle of recipients or the whole wide world. In essence, the online platform is the necessary, medium to make this transaction possible.

Where do states fit in? Basically, states have held the role of information intermediaries for their citizens or subjects since the day any type of organised society emerged. Immediately at birth humans are vested with state-provided information: a name, as well as a specific nationality. Without these a person cannot exist. A nameless or stateless person is unthinkable in human societies. This information is subsequently further enriched within modern, bureaucratic states: education and employment, family status, property rights, taxation and social security are all information (co-)created by states and their citizens or subjects.

It is with regard to this information that the most important role of states as information brokers comes into play: states safely store and further disseminate it. This function is of paramount importance to individuals. To live their lives in any meaningful manner individuals need to have their basic personal data, first, safely stored for the rest of their lives and, second, transmittable in a validated format by their respective states. In essence, this is the most important and fundamental role of states taking precedence even from the provision of security. At the end of the day, provision of security is meaningless unless the state’s function as an information intermediary has been provided and remains in effect—that is, unless the state knows who to protect.

What Do Individuals Want?

If states are information brokers for their citizens or subjects what is the role of individuals? Are they simply passive actors, co-creating information within boundaries set by their respective states? Or do they assume a more active role? In essence, what does any individual really want?

Individuals want to maximise their information processing. This wish is shared by all, throughout human history. From the time our ancestors drew on caves’ walls and improved their food gathering skills to the Greco-Roman age, the Renaissance and the Industrial Revolution, humans basically always tried, and succeeded, to increase their processing of information, to maximise their informational footprint. Or in Van Doren’s words “the history of mankind is the history of the progress and development of human knowledge. Universal history […] is no other than an account of how mankind’s knowledge has grown and changed over the ages”.

At a personal level, if it is knowledge that one is after then information processing is the way of life that that person has chosen. Even a quiet life, however, would be unattainable if new information did not compensate for inevitable change around us. And, for those after wealth, what are riches other than access to more information? In essence, all of human life and human experience can be viewed as the sum of the information around us.

Similarly, man’s wish to maximise its information processing includes the need for security. Unless humans are and feel secure their information processing cannot be maximised. On the other hand, this is as far as the connection between this basic quest and human rights or politics goes: increase of information processing may assumedly be favoured in free and democratic states but this may not be necessarily so. Human history is therefore a long march not towards democracy, freedom, human rights or any other (worthy) purpose, but simply towards information maximization.

The Traditional Role of States Being Eroded by Online Platforms

Under traditional state theory states exist first and foremost for the provision of security to their citizens or subjects. As most famously formulated in Hobbes’ Leviathan, outside a sovereign state man’s life would be “nasty, brutish, and short” (Leviathan, XIII, 9). It is to avoid this that individuals, essentially under a social contract theory, decide to forego some of their freedoms and organise themselves into states. The politics that these states can form from that point on go into any direction, ranging from democracy to monarchy or oligarchy.

What is revealing, however, for the purposes of this analysis in Hobbes’ book is its frontispiece: In it, a giant crowned figure is seen emerging from the landscape, clutching a sword and a crosier beneath a quote from the Book of Job (Non est potestas Super Terram quae Comparetur ei / There is no power on earth to be compared to him). The torso and arms of the giant are composed of over three hundred persons all facing away from the viewer, (see the relevant Wikipedia text).

The giant is obviously the state, composed of its citizens or subjects. It provides security to them (this is after all Hobbes’ main argument and the book’s raison d être), however how is it able to do that? Tellingly, by staying above the landscape, by seeing (and knowing) all, by exercising total control over it.

Throughout human history information processing was state-exclusive. As seen, the only thing individuals basically want is to increase their processing of information. Nevertheless, from the ancient Iron Age Empires to Greek city-states, the Roman empire or medieval empires in the West and the East, this was done almost exclusively within states’ (or, empires’) borders. With a small exception (small circles of merchants, soldiers or priests who travelled around) any and all data processing by individuals was performed locally within their respective states: individuals created families, studied, worked and transacted within closed, physical borders. There was no way to transact cross-border without state intervention, and thus control, either in the form of physical border-crossing and relevant paperwork or import/export taxes or, even worse, mandatory state permits to even leave town. This was as much true in our far past as also recently until the early 1990s, when the internet emerged.

States were therefore able to provide security to their subjects or citizens because they controlled their information flows. They knew everything, from business transactions to personal relationships. They basically controlled the flow of money and people through control of the relevant information. They could impose internal order by using this information and could protect from external enemies by being able to mobilise resources (people and material) upon which they had total and complete control. Within a states-as-platforms context, they co-created the information with their citizens or subjects, but they retained total control over this information to themselves.

As explained in a recent MCC conference last November, online platforms have eroded the above model by removing exclusive control of information from the states’ reach. By now individuals transact over platforms by-passing mandatory state controls (borders, customs etc.) of the past. They study online and acquire certificates from organisations that are not necessarily nationally accredited or supervised. They create cross-national communities and exchange information or carry out common projects without any state involvement. They have direct access to information generated outside their countries’ borders, completely uncontrolled by their governments. States, as information brokers profiting from exclusivity in this role now face competition by platforms.

This fundamentally affects the frontispiece in Leviathan above. The artist has chosen all of the persons composing the giant to have no face towards the viewer, to face the state. This has changed by the emergence of online platforms: individuals now carry faces, and are looking outwards, to the whole wide world, that has suddenly been opened-up to each one of us, in an unprecedented twist in human history.

The New Role of States

If the generally accepted basic role of states as providers of security is being eroded by online platforms, what can their role be in the future? The answer lies perhaps within the context of their role as information intermediaries (a.k.a. platforms), taking also into account that what individuals really want is to maximise their information processing: states need to facilitate such information processing.

Enabling maximised information processing carries wide and varied consequences for modern states. Free citizens that are and feel secure within a rule of law environment are in a better position to increase their informational footprint. Informed and educated individuals are able to better process information than uneducated ones. Transparent and open institutions facilitate information processing whereas decision-making behind closed doors stands in its way. Similarly, information needs to be free, or at least, accessible under fair conditions to everybody. It also needs to remain secure, inaccessible to anybody without a legitimate interest to it. Informational self-determination is a by-product of informational maximisation. The list can go on almost indefinitely, assuming an informational approach to human life per se.

The above do not affect, at least directly, the primary role of states as security providers. Evidently, this task will (and needs to) remain a state monopoly. Same is the case with other state monopolies, such as market regulation. However, under a states-as-platforms lens new policy options are opened while older assumptions may need to be revisited. At the end of the day, under a “pursuit of happiness” point of view, if happiness ultimately equals increased information processing, then states need to, if not facilitate, then at least allow such processing to take place.

Within the current digital environment online platforms are information structures that hold the role of information intermediaries, or even “gatekeepers”, among their users. What if a similar approach, that of an informational structure, was applied onto states as well? How would that affect their role under traditional state theory? The ‘States-as-Platforms’ Approach Under the current EU law approach, online platforms essentially “store and disseminate to the public information” (DSA, article 2). This broadly corresponds to the digital environment around us, accurately describing a service familiar to us all whereby an intermediary offers to the public an informational infrastructure (a “platform”) that stores data uploaded by a user and then, at the request of that same user, makes such data available to a wider audience, be it a closed circle of recipients or the whole wide world. In essence, the online platform is the necessary, medium to make this transaction possible. Where do states fit in? Basically, states have held the role of information intermediaries for their citizens or subjects since the day any type of organised society emerged. Immediately at birth humans are vested with state-provided information: a name, as well as a specific nationality. Without these a person cannot exist. A nameless or stateless person is unthinkable in human societies. This information is subsequently further enriched within modern, bureaucratic states: education and employment, family status, property rights, taxation and social security are all information (co-)created by states and their citizens or subjects. It is with regard to this information that the most important role of states as information brokers comes into play: states safely store and further disseminate it. This function is of paramount importance to individuals. To live their lives in any meaningful manner individuals need to have their basic personal data, first, safely stored for the rest of their lives and, second, transmittable in a validated format by their respective states. In essence, this is the most important and fundamental role of states taking precedence even from the provision of security. At the end of the day, provision of security is meaningless unless the state’s function as an information intermediary has been provided and remains in effect—that is, unless the state knows who to protect. What Do Individuals Want? If states are information brokers for their citizens or subjects what is the role of individuals? Are they simply passive actors, co-creating information within boundaries set by their respective states? Or do they assume a more active role? In essence, what does any individual really want?

From personalized learning apps to deepfake technology, AI is shaping how children interact with the digital world. While these advancements promise innovation in education, they also introduce significant challenges. How can we harness AI’s potential while protecting children from its risks?

AI’s Expanding Role in Education

AI-powered tools are transforming education at an unprecedented pace. Personalized learning platforms use machine learning to tailor lessons to individual students, helping them grasp complex topics at their own speed. Virtual tutors provide instant feedback, making education more accessible than ever before. These technologies have the potential to bridge learning gaps and create more equitable opportunities.

But AI isn’t a flawless solution. The rise of deepfake technology — AI-generated content that manipulates images, videos, or voices — has made misinformation a growing concern. What happens when children struggle to distinguish between reality and digital fabrications? As AI becomes more sophisticated, so must our ability to critically navigate the information it generates.

The Double-Edged Sword of AI in Child Development

Technology is a powerful tool, but it’s a double-edged sword when it comes to childhood development. Studies show that excessive screen time can hinder social skills, attention spans, and emotional regulation. AI-driven content, designed for engagement, can lead to digital addiction, pulling children further away from real-world interactions.

At the same time, responsible AI integration can enhance education and creativity. Virtual reality (VR) experiences bring history lessons to life, while AI-driven storytelling platforms encourage young minds to explore new narratives. The challenge lies in creating a balance — leveraging AI for educational enrichment without letting it dictate childhood experiences.

Safeguarding the Future: Regulation and Parental Involvement

The responsibility of managing AI’s influence on children doesn’t fall on one entity alone. Governments must implement regulations that ensure ethical AI use, particularly in education and media. Schools need to adopt AI with transparency, ensuring that students are not unknowingly subjected to biased algorithms or manipulative content.

Parents play a crucial role, too. Open conversations about AI, media literacy, and digital well-being can empower children to become critical consumers of technology. Setting boundaries — such as screen time limits and AI-free zones at home — can help maintain a healthy balance between online and offline life.

The Need for Thoughtful AI Integration

Artificial intelligence holds immense potential to revolutionize education, but it must be used responsibly. By prioritizing ethical considerations, fostering digital literacy, and advocating for smart regulations, we can create a future where AI enhances childhood experiences rather than diminishing them.

For this purpose, I believe that banning smartphones in classrooms — a step that Hungary has taken last year — allows students to focus on learning, but does not deprive them of guided use of AI. Sadly, there is a growing social media addiction among our youth, to which a banning of smartphones in school could provide a temporary relief. However, all countries desire a strong digital economy with great professionals, which requires us to embrace technology and live with it, but not be ruled by it.

The key isn’t to reject AI but to integrate it thoughtfully — ensuring that technology remains a tool for learning, not a replacement for genuine human connection.

But I would argue that our most important obligation is to be a bridge between those who came before us, and those who have just arrived into this world. Protecting our youth is not only the responsibility of parents or immediate family and friends of a child but every adult who comes into contact with the most vulnerable members of our society.

This manifests in several ways, but the one I wish to shed light upon is the cooperation between people who work in child protective services and other stakeholders, to modernize the governmental bodies and NGOs that help achieve this human duty to protect the next generation and try to act as a shield against abuse. As we can read in Psalm 82:3-4 of the Bible: ‘Give justice to the weak and the fatherless; maintain the right of the afflicted and the destitute. Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked.’

As more and more countries recognize the vital nature of child protection—in addition to their duty to care for their citizens, it is also a long-term investment for countries to bring up productive members of society—, new pieces of legislation are being enacted.

An example of this trend is Hungary, which is evaluated as a high-ranking country with regards to providing rights comprised in The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. However, the country has recently implemented several changes in its legal framework, all with the intention of strengthening child protective measures even further.

The Fundamental Law of Hungary, in Article XV, stipulates that ‘Hungary shall protect families, children, women, the elderly and those living with disabilities.’ This purpose is further expanded upon in Article XVI by stating that ‘Every child shall have the right to the protection and care necessary for his or her proper physical, mental and moral development.’ Recently, another legal provision was added to these obligations and checks in the constitution: Amendment 13 to the Fundamental Law of Hungary has been adopted, which means that now there is no presidential pardon for perpetrators of crimes against children.

‘In accordance with these aims, the Criminal Code now stipulates that sexual crimes against people under 18 shall never lapse’

However, this constitutional amendment is not the only change that took place. The amendments to Hungary’s Act XXXI of 1997 on the Protection of Children and the Administration of Guardianship, Act XI of 1991 on National Public Health and Medical Officer Service, and several other Acts on smaller issues related to children’s rights were adopted with 163 votes and 14 abstentions. The submitted proposal of the bill initially was supposed to provide an exception for clergymen obtaining information through confession, who would have not been obliged to report offences against children to child protective services because of their duty of confidentiality. However, this regulation never made it to the final version of amendments, as the proposer’s goal was to strengthen child protection in all aspects, leaving no room for offences to be left unpunished.

In accordance with these aims, the Criminal Code now stipulates that sexual crimes against people under 18 shall never lapse. To make the legal consequences of these heinous crimes even more severe, people convicted of imprisonment for such crimes shall not be released on probation. Perpetrators of these crimes will not be able to obtain parole, reintegration custody, or a certificate of good conduct. Moreover, Hungarian citizens who commit these offences abroad will also be included in a public database, ensuring comprehensive accountability regardless of where the crime occurs.

There would also be restrictions on who can organize camps for children: for example, those who have received community service or a fine for a deliberate offence would not be allowed to provide such a service for three years after they have been exempted from legal disqualifications.

The amendments also stipulate that leaders and staff of child protection institutions shall be screened for psychological aptitude. Candidates failing to pass the psychology test cannot be employed or should be dismissed without delay. An assessment of a worker’s ‘impeccable lifestyle’ could also be requested any time during their employment ‘once there is sufficient reason to assume that it is objectionable’, which assessment will be carried out by the police’s National Protection Service. As a standard, the impeccable conduct of staff would be checked no more than once a year. But a challenge arises out of this provision: what does it mean to have an impeccable lifestyle? The proposal would require workers to fill in a form asking whether they have a certificate, a medal, a disciplinary record, an economic interest, their income, etc.

This decision—while ensuring a high level of safety—also raises possible questions about how many new foster parents and child protective service workers would enter jobs aiming to protect the youth. A Hungarian researcher uncovered some key components[1] which led to the decline of social workers’ numbers, such as the low social prestige of child welfare and child protection work, fear of making mistakes and their consequences, the possibility of institutional investigation, and fear of threats from family members of children. These drawbacks and fears, combined with stricter requirements, may keep away several qualified and good-intentioned people from this field of work, which weakens the system. Professionals working with children who neglect to report situations where a child is at risk could face up to two years in prison now, further adding to workers’ concerns. The purpose of this amendment is to make child protection services aware of abuse and weed out the bad apples among foster parents and other workers. For this purpose, in March and April of 2024, all children’s homes were subjected to out-of-hours inspections. Despite the good intentions of lawmakers with these provisions, the crack-down was felt by child protective services, NGOs and other players in this sphere. So how could we help fight the shortage of workers in this field? How can we make sure that the most motivated and best professionals stay in this line of work, ensuring a high level of protection for the next generation?

‘How can we make sure that the most motivated and best professionals stay in this line of work…?’

A possibility could be easing the excessive bureaucratic and administrative burdens that professionals have by integrating modern technologies, specifically AI-driven models into this field. This way, professionals would have more free time to focus on children and their physical, mental and emotional development. Naturally, this would require dedication and resources on the side of the government, as well as foster parents, child protective services and other professionals. Learning about and employing innovative technologies to aid in situations like this might just be the way forward: if a child is provided with access to the internet, large-language models can be used to teach them better grammar, punctuation, vocabulary and even simple mathematical equations—with the guidance and supervision of the caretakers. Additionally, AI systems can help detect crimes and moderate content, providing learning tools for children, making them more employable in the future, while also making sure they are safe online.

To sum up, I have to give praise where praise is due: a crack-down of such magnitude will inevitably yield results when it comes to the general prevention of crimes against children. While vetting workers who have access to children is a necessary step to take, I believe that using additional tools to further aid in the goal of providing better opportunities for the next generation is the step that Hungary should take in order to become the most up-to-date, comprehensive and effective nation in this aspect. The resources poured into this endeavour will bring to fruition a new economic boom, better public safety, and ultimately, bridge the distance between values, opportunities and dreams of the Hungarians of yesterday, today and tomorrow.

The amendments to Hungary’s Act XXXI of 1997 on the Protection of Children and the Administration of Guardianship, Act XI of 1991 on National Public Health and Medical Officer Service, and several other Acts on smaller issues related to children’s rights were adopted with 163 votes and 14 abstentions. The submitted proposal of the bill initially was supposed to provide an exception for clergymen obtaining information through confession, who would have not been obliged to report offences against children to child protective services because of their duty of confidentiality. However, this regulation never made it to the final version of amendments, as the proposer’s goal was to strengthen child protection in all aspects, leaving no room for offences to be left unpunished. In accordance with these aims, the Criminal Code now stipulates that sexual crimes against people under 18 shall never lapse. To make the legal consequences of these heinous crimes even more severe, people convicted of imprisonment for such crimes shall not be released on probation. Perpetrators of these crimes will not be able to obtain parole, reintegration custody, or a certificate of good conduct. Moreover, Hungarian citizens who commit these offences abroad will also be included in a public database, ensuring comprehensive accountability regardless of where the crime occurs. There would also be restrictions on who can organize camps for children: for example, those who have received community service or a fine for a deliberate offence would not be allowed to provide such a service for three years after they have been exempted from legal disqualifications. The amendments also stipulate that leaders and staff of child protection institutions shall be screened for psychological aptitude. Candidates failing to pass the psychology test cannot be employed or should be dismissed without delay. An assessment of a worker’s ‘impeccable lifestyle’ could also be requested any time during their employment ‘once there is sufficient reason to assume that it is objectionable’, which assessment will be carried out by the police’s National Protection Service. As a standard, the impeccable conduct of staff would be checked no more than once a year. But a challenge arises out of this provision: what does it mean to have an impeccable lifestyle? The proposal would require workers to fill in a form asking whether they have a certificate, a medal, a disciplinary record, an economic interest, their income, etc. This decision—while ensuring a high level of safety—also raises possible questions about how many new foster parents and child protective service workers would enter jobs aiming to protect the youth. A Hungarian researcher uncovered some key components[1] which led to the decline of social workers’ numbers, such as the low social prestige of child welfare and child protection work, fear of making mistakes and their consequences, the possibility of institutional investigation, and fear of threats from family members of children. These drawbacks and fears, combined with stricter requirements, may keep away several qualified and good-intentioned people from this field of work, which weakens the system. Professionals working with children who neglect to report situations where a child is at risk could face up to two years in prison now, further adding to workers’ concerns. The purpose of this amendment is to make child protection services aware of abuse and weed out the bad apples among foster parents and other workers. For this purpose, in March and April of 2024, all children’s homes were subjected to out-of-hours inspections. Despite the good intentions of lawmakers with these provisions, the crack-down was felt by child protective services, NGOs and other players in this sphere. So how could we help fight the shortage of workers in this field? How can we make sure that the most motivated and best professionals stay in this line of work, ensuring a high level of protection for the next generation? ‘How can we make sure that the most motivated and best professionals stay in this line of work…?’ A possibility could be easing the excessive bureaucratic and administrative burdens that professionals have by integrating modern technologies, specifically AI-driven models into this field. This way, professionals would have more free time to focus on children and their physical, mental and emotional development. Naturally, this would require dedication and resources on the side of the government, as well as foster parents, child protective services and other professionals. Learning about and employing innovative technologies to aid in situations like this might just be the way forward: if a child is provided with access to the internet, large-language models can be used to teach them better grammar, punctuation, vocabulary and even simple mathematical equations—with the guidance and supervision of the caretakers. Additionally, AI systems can help detect crimes and moderate content, providing learning tools for children, making them more employable in the future, while also making sure they are safe online. To sum up, I have to give praise where praise is due: a crack-down of such magnitude will inevitably yield results when it comes to the general prevention of crimes against children. While vetting workers who have access to children is a necessary step to take, I believe that using additional tools to further aid in the goal of providing better opportunities for the next generation is the step that Hungary should take in order to become the most up-to-date, comprehensive and effective nation in this aspect. The resources poured into this endeavour will bring to fruition a new economic boom, better public safety, and ultimately, bridge the distance between values, opportunities and dreams of the Hungarians of yesterday, today and tomorrow.

The September 2025 protests in Nepal and the use of Discord to elect an interim prime minister show how, in the absence of institutional channels, digital platforms can assume functions of political legitimacy.

This case confirms that the prevailing logic of social media (based on algorithms for selecting individualised content and the centrality of the visual) tends to fragment public conversation and reinforce dynamics that favour structural effects such as polarisation, the circulation of misinformation and political ephemerality, which were also visible in the Nepalese process.

Bluetooth, which seemed to be a technology whose uses had been exhausted, took on a revolutionary role in Nepal by enabling meshnetworks capable of sustaining communication without the Internet, complemented by the massive use of VPNs in the face of blockages.

This experience does not transform the structural role of platforms, but it does offer clues as to how consensus-oriented redesigns could strengthen citizen autonomy in the digital public sphere.

Analysis[1]

1. An unprecedented case

In September 2025 Nepal experienced a wave of protests that shook the country and led to the resignation of Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli, the burning of the National Assembly and the imposition of a military curfew in the capital. More than 70 people died in clashes with the police during a social uprising that combined several factors: outrage over corruption and inequality, and rejection of the government’s digital control measures.

With the main social networks blocked, tens of thousands of young people moved the political debate to Discord, a messaging app associated with the world of video games. In a matter of days, this space became a kind of digital convention where programmes were discussed and even the name of an interim prime minister, former judge Sushila Karkiv, was proposed.

The fact that a platform designed for conversation among gamersbecame the central stage for national politics, receiving legitimacy from the military, marks an unprecedented episode.

In the first half of fiscal year 2025, Nepal’s real GDP grew by approximately 4.9%, but more than 20% of its population of 30 million still live below the poverty line and youth unemployment remains at around 20%. Income inequality, with a Gini index close to 30 points,has declined slightly compared with a decade ago, although significant gaps remain between urban and rural areas and between social groups. The lack of productive diversification pushes a large part of the working population to seek opportunities abroad: around 7.5% of Nepalese citizens work outside the country, mainly in the Gulf States and Malaysia. As a result, remittances account for more than a quarter of GDP and sustain domestic consumption, but at the same time generate a strong dependence on external factors and the stability of international labour markets.

Precisely because of these vulnerabilities and dependencies, Nepal has become an example of rapid economic digitisation, with a swift expansion of electronic payments, in response to the lack of an inclusive financial system and dependence on remittances.

In this context of inequality, in mid-2025 videos of the so-called #NepoKids, young people from wealthy political and business families showing off their vacations in luxury destinations, imported cars and designer clothes, went viral on TikTok and Instagram. For many young people, these videos were the spark that turned accumulated discontent into open outrage.

The government banned 26 social media and messaging apps, including Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and X. The measure sparked unprecedented youth protests, leaving dozens dead and forcing the prime minister to resign. Parliament was paralysed and the country entered a power vacuum. The decision to block the platforms was officially justified by their failure to comply with a prerequisite for registration in Nepal, imposed on large technology companies months earlier. The government claimed that these companies were operating without local oversight, which posed a problem of digital sovereignty and content control. However, the ban was perceived as an attempt to silence the wave of outrage.

Having social media is not a right, but banning them does violate one, especially in countries with a large diaspora such as Nepal, where social media are the only means of communication with family and friends abroad.

The public response then took an unexpected turn. Discord became the main space for political deliberation. More than 100,000 people joined the Youths Against Corruption server, where programmes were debated, candidates were presented, and open votes were organised and broadcast on local media.

From this process, the former judge Sushila Karki emerged as the consensus candidate, a proposal that was recognised by military leaders and the president, who accepted the result as a legitimate way out of the crisis. Karki was sworn in as interim prime minister, becoming the first woman to hold the position.

This episode raises the question: are we witnessing a temporary exception to the trend in which social media erodes social cohesion and democratic functioning or the beginning of a change of course that could open up new possibilities?

2. The dominant logic on social media

This process of digital deliberation should not be interpreted as a structural transformation of the political role of digital platforms. The dominant pattern (or, in the terms of the Prosocial Media article, its ‘pathologies’) remains very different.

Two features of social media show the extent to which the case of Nepal fits into this dominant logic:

Individualised feeds using ranking algorithms. Each user receives a different selection of content, ordered according to what generates the most interaction. This fragments the experience and turns political conversation into a sequence of isolated perceptions. In Nepal young people saw a constant stream of symbols of outrage on their screens, such as the #NepoKids videos, which reinforced the idea of a widespread consensus against the elites. Other segments of the population, on the other hand, barely understood the sources of young people’s frustration.

Primacy of the visual and the emotional. Platforms such as TikTok and Instagram are designed to privilege images and videos that produce an immediate reaction. If the protests in Nepal reached every smartphone on the planet, it was because of the viral spread of scenes such as the Parliament in flames or ministers being thrown into the river.

These two design elements give rise to three structural problems that are not unique to Nepal, but rather the norm in the contemporary digital ecosystem: polarisation; disinformation; and political ephemerality.

2.1. Polarisation

Political polarisation mediated by digital platforms is a widely documented phenomenon globally. Personalisation algorithms tend to lock users into like-minded bubbles and give greater visibility to extreme content. The circulation of memes and political messages occurs mainly in homogeneous communities, which reduces exposure to divergent perspectives.

For instance, following Facebook’s 2018 update that prioritised ‘meaningful social interactions’, surveys in Italy recorded an increase in ideological and emotional polarisation. When social interaction signals (such as likes and shares) are weighted more heavily, extreme content easily climbs to the top of feeds.

On 6 August 2025, just over a month before the outbreak, Instagram introduced the ‘repost’ feature, similar to TikTok’s, which allowed for the rapid dissemination and amplification of posts. The Nepalese magazine Himalmag identified this development as a milestone in the chronology of events that led to the protests. According to Himalmag, the ability to share posts instantly facilitated the mass dissemination of memes and political messages, amplifying the perception of polarisation in a context already marked by mistrust.

An experimental study with Facebook users during the 2020 US elections showed that removing reshares from feeds substantially reduced exposure to political news, including unreliable content, as users will tend to see more content shared by people they follow. It also decreased the number of clicks, reactions and visits to partisan news, and led to a decline in users’ political knowledge. However, the treatment did not change ideological polarisation or individual political attitudes.

Social media design decisions must be tested in electoral situations, protest scenarios and everyday life: stress tests that allow to anticipate their effects in different political and social contexts.

2.2. Disinformation

Disinformation has become a structural feature of the global digital ecosystem. Ranking algorithms prioritise content that generates immediate reactions, which favours the virality of false content.

In India, for instance, around 13% of images shared in WhatsApp groups were disinformation content. Furthermore, images and videos are more difficult to verify than text. Although advances in computer vision are beginning to improve automatic detection capabilities, they do not surpass text filters. A study by Texas A&M shows that on Facebook, the main source of disinformation is not fake articles on external websites, but imagescirculating directly in the feed.

In Nepal, according to the Center for Media Research (CMR-Nepal), between March 2020 and July 2024, 408 fact-checking reports on misinformation were published. Up to 56% of the misinformation originated on social media, while 36% came from print or online media. A 2021 survey by CMR-Nepal itself concluded that nine out of 10 social media users had received misinformation in the last week, mainly through Facebook, YouTube and X. During the recent protests, the spread of rumours confirmed the magnitude of the problem: false reports circulated about vandalism at the Pashupatinath temple, about alleged demands to declare Nepal a Hindu state and about the burning of the home of a former prime minister’s wife. Some users even shared the private addresses of political leaders, leading to threats and attacks, a practice known in Internet slang as doxxing.

2.3. Political ephemerality

Platforms reproduce the presentism of the 24-hour cycle, generating peaks of attention that rarely last over time. Although networks amplify and facilitate immediate coordination, they make it difficult to maintain a focus on structural problems.

Without continuity, digital protests tend to dissolve into a succession of episodes with no common thread. Ephemerality, in this respect, erodes the ability to translate the energy of the digital street into stable political structures.

In India the feminist movement following the 2012 Delhi gang rape (also known as the Nirbhaya case) showed the enormous power of social media to channel outrage and bring hundreds of thousands of people to the streets. Years later, hashtags such as #MeTooIndia succeeded in making testimonies visible and opening up previously non-existent public debates. However, several studies have documented that this initial energy tended to dissipate quickly: the cycle of attention on social media was concentrated in a few days or weeks, while sustained change depended more on institutional reforms and organised action by civil society groups than on digital conversation. This pattern explains why figures such as Natasha Badhwar, co-curator of Genderlog (a collaborative website on gender-based violence in India), preferred to first publish a reflective blog or newspaper column before moving the debate to Twitter.

3. Possible signs of change

It is in the everyday uses of technology that networks are built that, in times of crisis, can take on an unexpected political role. Social media should be understood as a digital public sphere. Nepal is an exceptional case that, while not reversing the dominant trend, does offer signs that are worth following closely.

3.1. New connectivities

Several governments are moving towards more centralised Internet models, with national gateways that concentrate traffic control and facilitate blocking and surveillance, similar to the Chinese model. In 2023 Nepal approved a cybersecurity policy that included a National Internet Gateway, designed to centralise access to the network and exercise greater state control. What alternatives are there?

3.1.1. The Bluetooth revolution and mesh networks

Bluetooth is a technology that seemed to have exhausted its uses, but it has found a new role in crisis contexts: providing resilient communication in the face of blockages and blackouts. Meshnetworks allow each device to act as a node, transmitting data to the next one, so that no telecommunications tower or central server is needed. One’s own phone can be used to connect to other nearby users and, by adding nodes, a mesh is created that can sustain communication even without the Internet.

In Nepal this possibility materialised with Bitchat, a messaging app created in a weekend by a small group of developers, including Jack Dorsey, founder of Twitter. The app recorded more than 48,000 downloads in a few days, allowing local messaging via Bluetooth without the need for phone numbers or a network connection.

Something similar occurred during the 2019 protests in Hong Kong, where AirDrop, Apple’s feature for sharing files between nearby devices, became a key tool for distributing messages and pamphlets without relying on the Internet. That ability to circumvent both censorship and blackouts was later reduced when Apple introduced an update in China that limited open reception of AirDrop to just 10 minutes.

3.1.2. VPNs, from being used to hide illegal actions to gaining worldwide adoption

For years, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) were associated with anonymity for illegal activities. Over the past decade their use has spread as a tool to protect privacy and circumvent blocks. By encrypting the connection and redirecting it through external servers, they allow users to hide their location and bypass geographical blocks or government censorship. In Nepal, following the September 2025 blockade, downloads of Proton VPN grew by 8,000% in only a few days.

Figure 6. Daily VPN logs in Nepal (% increase over average)

This pattern is repeated elsewhere: in France, when Pornhub was blocked, VPN signups skyrocketed by 1,000%; and in the rest of Europe, the introduction of age verification measures to restrict minors’ access to pornographic content points in the same direction: a widespread increase in the everyday use of VPNs.

3.2. Platform diversification

The digital ecosystem in Nepal reflects a high degree of concentration, as in the vast majority of countries. According to Data Reportal (January 2024) there were 13.5 million active users on Facebook, 10.85 million on Facebook Messenger, 3.6 million on Instagram, 1.5 million on LinkedIn and 466,100 on X. This dependence on a few global platforms turns social media into ‘choke points’, single points of control where a block or corporate decision can immediately disrupt communication for millions of people.

Diversification of platforms would pave the way for an ecosystem less vulnerable to censorship or centralised manipulation. Ideally, we should move towards a landscape where there are more niche applications designed for specific functions rather than platforms that concentrate all social interactions. Networks such as Letterboxd, for movie reviews, or Strava, for sharing fitnesshabits, are good examples.

The other lever is interoperability, understood as the ability of different platforms to communicate with each other. Combined with social graph portability (the ability to transfer one’s network of contacts from one application to another), this would allow users to maintain their social connections even if they change services or an application is blocked.

3.3. Platforms for consensus building: bridging and balancing

Most social networks are designed to maximise attention through feeds. The move of thousands of young Nepalese to Discord showed, albeit chaotically, that conversation-centred environments allow for different dynamics: less passive consumption and more need for debate and moderation.

Most participants agreed on rejecting corruption, inequality and the country’s political elite, which led to an agreement on the need for an alternative leadership. But the consensus also clashed with deep historical divisions. Territorial decentralisation, the core of Nepal’s transition to federalism since 2015, remains a source of political tension, entangled with ethnic and regional divisions. The constitution recognises three levels of government under principles of cooperation and coexistence but, in practice, powers are fraught with ambiguities: states claim legislative autonomy, while the federal government retains strong control. These disputes reflect the long history of centralisation around the Hindu Brahmin/Kshetri elites in Kathmandu versus the demands for recognition and self-government by Madhesi, Janajati and Dalit communities.

Experience has shown that conversation-centred networks can generate minimal consensus on shared problems, but they also expose the difficulty of negotiating identity and territorial conflicts that have plagued Nepalese society for decades.

This limitation is linked to a problem of temporality and design. On Discord, much of the stability depended on volunteer moderators, who filtered messages, contained calls for violence and organised conversations, without being prepared to do so. The moderators on platforms such as Reddit and Discord are informal political agents who ensure order, but without institutional recognition.

Faced with these limitations, some projects have sought other design frameworks. The most cited is Pol.is, a social network developed in Taiwan that incorporates two principles:

Bridging: this consists of giving more relevance to content that receives support from different communities. For example, if two opposing ideological groups agree on a statement, that statement rises in visibility.

Balancing: this ensures that all relevant communities are represented in the debate, preventing minority voices from being invisible. This encourages internal pluralism, even within the same group.

The authors of Prosocial Media have proposed incorporating this logic into the platform interface. Their idea is that each post should show indicators of whether it is acting as bridging or balancing, accompanied by tools to explore which subgroups support or reject a statement. This type of design would make the health of the conversation visible and give more weight to consensus than to extremes.

Conclusions

What comes next?

In Nepal the coming months will be characterised by instability and doubts about the legitimacy of the process. The digital appointment of an interim prime minister does not solve the underlying problem, which will have to be resolved by the new leaders emerging from this process. It is likely that a timetable for new elections will be announced in the coming months, along with constitutional reforms to respond to the demands of the protesters. Among the most prominent figures is Balen Shah, the Mayor of Kathmandu, who is very popular among young people. He refused to stand as interim prime minister but has support within the movement to be a candidate in the next elections.

The challenge for Shah, Karki and other emerging leaders is to convert their popularity into parliamentary capacity. They need a party that can field enough candidates to achieve a legislative majority. They also require militant structures in rural areas, where electoral logistics are more complicated. Added to this is ethnic and linguistic fragmentation, as well as the persistence of patrimonialist networks, which require the presentation of local candidates with whom communities feel represented.

At the same time, a broader regional scenario is emerging. There is a wave of youth-led protests in several Asian countries such as Bangladesh, Indonesia and Sri Lanka. Some observers are beginning to talk about an Asian Spring. As seen in the Arab Spring, social media has the potential to turn local outbreaks into transnational movements, making it easier for a protest in one country to inspire and fuel others in the region.

It is striking to note that, from 2012 to today, the trajectory of these platforms has led further away from democracy rather than bringing people closer. At the time, it was thought that social media could expand the public sphere and strengthen collective action; today, the evidence suggests that their designs prioritise fragmentation and conflict. There are no solid reasons to believe that the current design of large networks can improve social cohesion or democratic functioning.

In the coming months it will be of great interest to review the recordings from Discord’s servers to identify which moderation dynamics, Discord features and informal organisational techniques worked and which did not in order to inspire other countries about what practices might be useful and what mistakes should not be repeated.

Discord poll in which the new interim prime minister was elected with 50% of the votes Source: @neorohit/X. This episode raises the question: are we witnessing a temporary exception to the trend in which social media erodes social cohesion and democratic functioning or the beginning of a change of course that could open up new possibilities? 2. The dominant logic on social media This process of digital deliberation should not be interpreted as a structural transformation of the political role of digital platforms. The dominant pattern (or, in the terms of the Prosocial Media article, its ‘pathologies’) remains very different. Two features of social media show the extent to which the case of Nepal fits into this dominant logic: Individualised feeds using ranking algorithms. Each user receives a different selection of content, ordered according to what generates the most interaction. This fragments the experience and turns political conversation into a sequence of isolated perceptions. In Nepal young people saw a constant stream of symbols of outrage on their screens, such as the #NepoKids videos, which reinforced the idea of a widespread consensus against the elites. Other segments of the population, on the other hand, barely understood the sources of young people’s frustration. Figure 3. TikTok video calling for exposure of the lifestyle of young people from Nepal’s economic and political elites Source: TikTok Primacy of the visual and the emotional. Platforms such as TikTok and Instagram are designed to privilege images and videos that produce an immediate reaction. If the protests in Nepal reached every smartphone on the planet, it was because of the viral spread of scenes such as the Parliament in flames or ministers being thrown into the river. Figure 4. TikTok video showing the finance minister being thrown into the river, chased and assaulted Source: TikTok. Figure 5. TikTok video of the National Assembly in Kathmandu on fire Source: TikTok. These two design elements give rise to three structural problems that are not unique to Nepal, but rather the norm in the contemporary digital ecosystem: polarisation; disinformation; and political ephemerality. 2.1. Polarisation Political polarisation mediated by digital platforms is a widely documented phenomenon globally. Personalisation algorithms tend to lock users into like-minded bubbles and give greater visibility to extreme content. The circulation of memes and political messages occurs mainly in homogeneous communities, which reduces exposure to divergent perspectives. For instance, following Facebook’s 2018 update that prioritised ‘meaningful social interactions’, surveys in Italy recorded an increase in ideological and emotional polarisation. When social interaction signals (such as likes and shares) are weighted more heavily, extreme content easily climbs to the top of feeds. On 6 August 2025, just over a month before the outbreak, Instagram introduced the ‘repost’ feature, similar to TikTok’s, which allowed for the rapid dissemination and amplification of posts. The Nepalese magazine Himalmag identified this development as a milestone in the chronology of events that led to the protests. According to Himalmag, the ability to share posts instantly facilitated the mass dissemination of memes and political messages, amplifying the perception of polarisation in a context already marked by mistrust. An experimental study with Facebook users during the 2020 US elections showed that removing reshares from feeds substantially reduced exposure to political news, including unreliable content, as users will tend to see more content shared by people they follow. It also decreased the number of clicks, reactions and visits to partisan news, and led to a decline in users’ political knowledge. However, the treatment did not change ideological polarisation or individual political attitudes. Social media design decisions must be tested in electoral situations, protest scenarios and everyday life: stress tests that allow to anticipate their effects in different political and social contexts. 2.2. Disinformation Disinformation has become a structural feature of the global digital ecosystem. Ranking algorithms prioritise content that generates immediate reactions, which favours the virality of false content. In India, for instance, around 13% of images shared in WhatsApp groups were disinformation content. Furthermore, images and videos are more difficult to verify than text. Although advances in computer vision are beginning to improve automatic detection capabilities, they do not surpass text filters. A study by Texas A&M shows that on Facebook, the main source of disinformation is not fake articles on external websites, but imagescirculating directly in the feed. In Nepal, according to the Center for Media Research (CMR-Nepal), between March 2020 and July 2024, 408 fact-checking reports on misinformation were published. Up to 56% of the misinformation originated on social media, while 36% came from print or online media. A 2021 survey by CMR-Nepal itself concluded that nine out of 10 social media users had received misinformation in the last week, mainly through Facebook, YouTube and X. During the recent protests, the spread of rumours confirmed the magnitude of the problem: false reports circulated about vandalism at the Pashupatinath temple, about alleged demands to declare Nepal a Hindu state and about the burning of the home of a former prime minister’s wife. Some users even shared the private addresses of political leaders, leading to threats and attacks, a practice known in Internet slang as doxxing. 2.3. Political ephemerality Platforms reproduce the presentism of the 24-hour cycle, generating peaks of attention that rarely last over time. Although networks amplify and facilitate immediate coordination, they make it difficult to maintain a focus on structural problems. Without continuity, digital protests tend to dissolve into a succession of episodes with no common thread. Ephemerality, in this respect, erodes the ability to translate the energy of the digital street into stable political structures. In India the feminist movement following the 2012 Delhi gang rape (also known as the Nirbhaya case) showed the enormous power of social media to channel outrage and bring hundreds of thousands of people to the streets. Years later, hashtags such as #MeTooIndia succeeded in making testimonies visible and opening up previously non-existent public debates. However, several studies have documented that this initial energy tended to dissipate quickly: the cycle of attention on social media was concentrated in a few days or weeks, while sustained change depended more on institutional reforms and organised action by civil society groups than on digital conversation. This pattern explains why figures such as Natasha Badhwar, co-curator of Genderlog (a collaborative website on gender-based violence in India), preferred to first publish a reflective blog or newspaper column before moving the debate to Twitter. 3. Possible signs of change It is in the everyday uses of technology that networks are built that, in times of crisis, can take on an unexpected political role. Social media should be understood as a digital public sphere. Nepal is an exceptional case that, while not reversing the dominant trend, does offer signs that are worth following closely. 3.1. New connectivities Several governments are moving towards more centralised Internet models, with national gateways that concentrate traffic control and facilitate blocking and surveillance, similar to the Chinese model. In 2023 Nepal approved a cybersecurity policy that included a National Internet Gateway, designed to centralise access to the network and exercise greater state control. What alternatives are there? 3.1.1. The Bluetooth revolution and mesh networks Bluetooth is a technology that seemed to have exhausted its uses, but it has found a new role in crisis contexts: providing resilient communication in the face of blockages and blackouts. Meshnetworks allow each device to act as a node, transmitting data to the next one, so that no telecommunications tower or central server is needed. One’s own phone can be used to connect to other nearby users and, by adding nodes, a mesh is created that can sustain communication even without the Internet. In Nepal this possibility materialised with Bitchat, a messaging app created in a weekend by a small group of developers, including Jack Dorsey, founder of Twitter. The app recorded more than 48,000 downloads in a few days, allowing local messaging via Bluetooth without the need for phone numbers or a network connection. Something similar occurred during the 2019 protests in Hong Kong, where AirDrop, Apple’s feature for sharing files between nearby devices, became a key tool for distributing messages and pamphlets without relying on the Internet. That ability to circumvent both censorship and blackouts was later reduced when Apple introduced an update in China that limited open reception of AirDrop to just 10 minutes. 3.1.2. VPNs, from being used to hide illegal actions to gaining worldwide adoption For years, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) were associated with anonymity for illegal activities. Over the past decade their use has spread as a tool to protect privacy and circumvent blocks. By encrypting the connection and redirecting it through external servers, they allow users to hide their location and bypass geographical blocks or government censorship. In Nepal, following the September 2025 blockade, downloads of Proton VPN grew by 8,000% in only a few days. Figure 6. Daily VPN logs in Nepal (% increase over average) Source: shared by Proton AG, the Swiss provider of Proton VPN. This pattern is repeated elsewhere: in France, when Pornhub was blocked, VPN signups skyrocketed by 1,000%; and in the rest of Europe, the introduction of age verification measures to restrict minors’ access to pornographic content points in the same direction: a widespread increase in the everyday use of VPNs. 3.2. Platform diversification The digital ecosystem in Nepal reflects a high degree of concentration, as in the vast majority of countries. According to Data Reportal (January 2024) there were 13.5 million active users on Facebook, 10.85 million on Facebook Messenger, 3.6 million on Instagram, 1.5 million on LinkedIn and 466,100 on X. This dependence on a few global platforms turns social media into ‘choke points’, single points of control where a block or corporate decision can immediately disrupt communication for millions of people. Diversification of platforms would pave the way for an ecosystem less vulnerable to censorship or centralised manipulation. Ideally, we should move towards a landscape where there are more niche applications designed for specific functions rather than platforms that concentrate all social interactions. Networks such as Letterboxd, for movie reviews, or Strava, for sharing fitnesshabits, are good examples. The other lever is interoperability, understood as the ability of different platforms to communicate with each other. Combined with social graph portability (the ability to transfer one’s network of contacts from one application to another), this would allow users to maintain their social connections even if they change services or an application is blocked. 3.3. Platforms for consensus building: bridging and balancing Most social networks are designed to maximise attention through feeds. The move of thousands of young Nepalese to Discord showed, albeit chaotically, that conversation-centred environments allow for different dynamics: less passive consumption and more need for debate and moderation. Most participants agreed on rejecting corruption, inequality and the country’s political elite, which led to an agreement on the need for an alternative leadership. But the consensus also clashed with deep historical divisions. Territorial decentralisation, the core of Nepal’s transition to federalism since 2015, remains a source of political tension, entangled with ethnic and regional divisions. The constitution recognises three levels of government under principles of cooperation and coexistence but, in practice, powers are fraught with ambiguities: states claim legislative autonomy, while the federal government retains strong control. These disputes reflect the long history of centralisation around the Hindu Brahmin/Kshetri elites in Kathmandu versus the demands for recognition and self-government by Madhesi, Janajati and Dalit communities. Experience has shown that conversation-centred networks can generate minimal consensus on shared problems, but they also expose the difficulty of negotiating identity and territorial conflicts that have plagued Nepalese society for decades. This limitation is linked to a problem of temporality and design. On Discord, much of the stability depended on volunteer moderators, who filtered messages, contained calls for violence and organised conversations, without being prepared to do so. The moderators on platforms such as Reddit and Discord are informal political agents who ensure order, but without institutional recognition. Faced with these limitations, some projects have sought other design frameworks. The most cited is Pol.is, a social network developed in Taiwan that incorporates two principles: Bridging: this consists of giving more relevance to content that receives support from different communities. For example, if two opposing ideological groups agree on a statement, that statement rises in visibility. Balancing: this ensures that all relevant communities are represented in the debate, preventing minority voices from being invisible. This encourages internal pluralism, even within the same group. The authors of Prosocial Media have proposed incorporating this logic into the platform interface. Their idea is that each post should show indicators of whether it is acting as bridging or balancing, accompanied by tools to explore which subgroups support or reject a statement. This type of design would make the health of the conversation visible and give more weight to consensus than to extremes. Figure 7. Proposed prosocial interface Conclusions What comes next? In Nepal the coming months will be characterised by instability and doubts about the legitimacy of the process. The digital appointment of an interim prime minister does not solve the underlying problem, which will have to be resolved by the new leaders emerging from this process. It is likely that a timetable for new elections will be announced in the coming months, along with constitutional reforms to respond to the demands of the protesters. Among the most prominent figures is Balen Shah, the Mayor of Kathmandu, who is very popular among young people. He refused to stand as interim prime minister but has support within the movement to be a candidate in the next elections. The challenge for Shah, Karki and other emerging leaders is to convert their popularity into parliamentary capacity. They need a party that can field enough candidates to achieve a legislative majority. They also require militant structures in rural areas, where electoral logistics are more complicated. Added to this is ethnic and linguistic fragmentation, as well as the persistence of patrimonialist networks, which require the presentation of local candidates with whom communities feel represented. At the same time, a broader regional scenario is emerging. There is a wave of youth-led protests in several Asian countries such as Bangladesh, Indonesia and Sri Lanka. Some observers are beginning to talk about an Asian Spring. As seen in the Arab Spring, social media has the potential to turn local outbreaks into transnational movements, making it easier for a protest in one country to inspire and fuel others in the region. It is striking to note that, from 2012 to today, the trajectory of these platforms has led further away from democracy rather than bringing people closer. At the time, it was thought that social media could expand the public sphere and strengthen collective action; today, the evidence suggests that their designs prioritise fragmentation and conflict. There are no solid reasons to believe that the current design of large networks can improve social cohesion or democratic functioning. In the coming months it will be of great interest to review the recordings from Discord’s servers to identify which moderation dynamics, Discord features and informal organisational techniques worked and which did not in order to inspire other countries about what practices might be useful and what mistakes should not be repeated.

Las protestas de septiembre de 2025 en Nepal y el uso de Discord para elegir una primera ministra interina muestran cómo, en ausencia de canales institucionales, las plataformas digitales pueden asumir funciones de legitimidad política.

Este caso confirma que la lógica predominante de las redes sociales (basada en algoritmos de selección de contenido individualizado y la centralidad de lo visual) tiende a fragmentar la conversación pública y a reforzar dinámicas que favorecen efectos estructurales como la polarización, la circulación de desinformación y la efimeridad política, visibles también en el proceso nepalí.

El Bluetooth, que parecía una tecnología con sus usos agotados, adquirió en Nepal un papel revolucionario al posibilitar redes mesh capaces de sostener la comunicación sin internet, complementadas por el uso masivo de redes privadas virtuales frente a los bloqueos.

Esta experiencia no transforma el papel estructural de las plataformas, pero ofrece señales sobre cómo rediseños orientados al consenso podrían fortalecer la autonomía ciudadana en la esfera pública digital.

Análisis[1]:

1. Un caso inédito

Nepal vivió en septiembre de 2025 una ola de protestas que sacudió el país y desembocó en la dimisión del primer ministro Khadga Prasad Oli, el incendio de la Asamblea Nacional y la imposición de un toque de queda militar en la capital. Más de 70 personas murieron en los enfrentamientos con la policía, en un estallido social que combinó varios aspectos: la indignación frente a la corrupción y la desigualdad y el rechazo a las medidas de control digital del gobierno.

Con las principales redes sociales bloqueadas, decenas de miles de jóvenes trasladaron el debate político a Discord, una aplicación de mensajería asociada al mundo de los videojuegos. En cuestión de días, este espacio se convirtió en una suerte de convención digital donde se discutieron programas y se propuso incluso el nombre de una primera ministra interina, la exmagistrada Sushila Karki.

Que una plataforma pensada para la conversación entre gamers se transformara en el escenario central de la política nacional, recibiendo la legitimidad del poder militar, marca un episodio sin precedentes.

En el primer semestre del año fiscal 2025, su PIB real creció aproximadamente un 4,9%, pero más del 20% de su población de 30 millones de personas sigue viviendo bajo el umbral de pobreza y el desempleo juvenil se mantiene en torno al 20%. La desigualdad de ingresos, con un índice de Gini cercano a 30 puntos, ha descendido ligeramente respecto a hace una década, aunque persisten fuertes brechas entre áreas urbanas y rurales y entre grupos sociales. La falta de diversificación productiva empuja a gran parte de la población activa a buscar oportunidades en el exterior: alrededor del 7,5% de los nepaleses trabaja fuera del país, principalmente en los Estados del Golfo y Malasia. Como resultado, las remesas equivalen a más de una cuarta parte del PIB y sostienen el consumo interno, aunque al mismo tiempo generan una fuerte dependencia de factores externos y de la estabilidad de los mercados laborales internacionales.

Precisamente por estas vulnerabilidades y dependencias, Nepal se ha convertido en un ejemplo de rápida digitalización económica, con una rápida expansión de los pagos electrónicos, como respuesta a la falta de un sistema financiero inclusivo y a la dependencia de las remesas.

En este contexto de desigualdad, a mediados de 2025, se viralizaron en TikTok e Instagram vídeos de los llamados #NepoKids, jóvenes pertenecientes a familias políticas y empresariales adineradas que mostraban sus vacaciones en destinos de lujo, coches importados y ropa de marca. Para muchos jóvenes, esos vídeos fueron la chispa que convirtió el malestar acumulado en indignación abierta.

El gobierno prohibió 26 redes sociales y aplicaciones de mensajería, entre ellas Facebook, Instagram, YouTube y X. La medida desató una protesta juvenil de dimensiones inéditas, que dejó decenas de muertos y forzó la dimisión del primer ministro. El Parlamento quedó paralizado y el país entró en un vacío de poder. La decisión de bloquear las plataformas se justificó oficialmente por el incumplimiento de un requisito previo de registro en Nepal, impuesto a las grandes tecnológicas meses antes. El gobierno alegó que estas empresas operaban sin supervisión local, lo que representaba un problema de soberanía digital y de control de contenidos. Sin embargo, la prohibición fue percibida como un intento de silenciar la ola de indignación.

Tener redes sociales no es un derecho, pero prohibirlas sí supone vulnerar uno, especialmente en países con una gran diáspora como Nepal, donde las redes sociales son el único medio de comunicación con familiares y amigos en el extranjero.

La respuesta ciudadana dio entonces un giro inesperado. Discord se convirtió en el principal espacio de deliberación política. Más de 100.000 personas se unieron al servidor Youths Against Corruption, donde se debatieron programas, se presentaron candidaturas y se organizaron votaciones abiertas transmitidas en medios locales.

De ese proceso emergió como candidata de consenso la exmagistrada Sushila Karki, propuesta que fue reconocida por los líderes militares y por el presidente, quienes aceptaron el resultado como salida legítima a la crisis. Karki fue juramentada como primera ministra interina, convirtiéndose en la primera mujer en ocupar el cargo.

Este episodio pone sobre la mesa la pregunta: ¿estamos ante una excepción pasajera dentro de la tendencia en la que las redes erosionan la cohesión social y el funcionamiento democrático, o ante el inicio de un cambio de rumbo que podría abrir nuevas posibilidades?

2. La lógica dominante en las redes sociales

Este proceso de deliberación digital no debe interpretarse como una transformación estructural del papel político de las plataformas digitales. El patrón dominante (o, en los términos del artículo Prosocial Media, sus “patologías”) sigue siendo otro, muy distinto.

Dos rasgos de las redes sociales muestran hasta qué punto el caso de Nepal se inserta en esta lógica dominante:

Feeds individualizados mediante algoritmos de ranking. Cada usuario recibe una selección de contenidos distinta, ordenada en función de lo que más interacción genera. Esto fragmenta la experiencia y convierte la conversación política en una secuencia de percepciones aisladas. En Nepal, los jóvenes veían en sus pantallas un flujo constante de símbolos de indignación, como los vídeos de los #NepoKids, que reforzaban la idea de un consenso generalizado contra las élites. Otros segmentos de la población, en cambio, apenas comprendían cuáles eran las fuentes de frustración de la juventud.

Figura 3. Vídeo en el que se pide exponer el estilo de vida de los jóvenes de las élites económicas y políticas de Nepal

Primacía de lo visual y lo emocional. Las plataformas como TikTok e Instagram están diseñadas para privilegiar imágenes y vídeos que producen una reacción inmediata. Si las protestas en Nepal llegaron a todos los smartphones del planeta fue por la viralización de escenas como el Parlamento en llamas o los ministros arrojados al río.

Figura 4. Vídeo en el que el ministro de Finanzas es arrojado al río, perseguido y agredido

Figura 5. Vídeo del incendio de la Asamblea Nacional, Katmandú

De estos dos elementos de diseño se derivan tres problemas estructurales que no son exclusivos de Nepal, sino la norma en el ecosistema digital contemporáneo.

2.1. Polarización

La polarización política mediada por plataformas digitales es un fenómeno ampliamente documentado a nivel global. Los algoritmos de personalización tienden a encerrar a los usuarios en burbujas afines y a dar mayor visibilidad a contenidos extremos. La circulación de memes y mensajes políticos se da sobre todo en comunidades homogéneas, lo cual reduce la exposición a perspectivas divergentes.

Por ejemplo, tras la actualización de Facebook en 2018 que priorizó las “interacciones sociales significativas”, encuestas en Italia registraron un aumento de la polarización ideológica y afectiva. Cuando se ponderan más las señales de interacción social (como likes y compartidos), los contenidos extremos escalan con facilidad hasta los primeros puestos de los feeds.

El 6 de agosto de 2025, poco más de un mes antes del estallido, Instagram introdujo la función de “repost”, similar a la de TikTok, que permitió la difusión y amplificación rápida de publicaciones. La revista nepalí Himalmag identificó esta novedad como un hito en la cronología de hechos que desembocaron en las protestas. Según Himalmag, la posibilidad de compartir publicaciones de manera instantánea habría facilitado la difusión masiva de memes y mensajes políticos, amplificando la percepción de polarización en un contexto ya marcado por la desconfianza.

Un estudio experimental con usuarios de Facebook durante las elecciones estadounidenses de 2020 mostró que eliminar los reshares de los feeds redujo de forma sustancial la exposición a noticias políticas, incluyendo contenidos de baja fiabilidad, ya que el usuario verá preferiblemente el contenido compartido por las personas a las que sigue. También disminuyó el número de clics, reacciones y visitas a noticias partidistas, y produjo un descenso en el nivel de conocimiento político de los usuarios. Sin embargo, el tratamiento no modificó la polarización ideológica ni las actitudes políticas individuales.

Las decisiones de diseño de redes sociales deben someterse a pruebas en situaciones electorales, en escenarios de protesta y en la vida cotidiana: stress tests que permitan anticipar sus efectos en distintos contextos políticos y sociales.

2.2. Desinformación

La desinformación se ha convertido en un rasgo estructural del ecosistema digital global. Los algoritmos de ranking priorizan los contenidos que generan reacciones inmediatas, lo que favorece la viralidad del contenido falso.

En la India, por ejemplo, se constató que alrededor del 13% de las imágenes compartidas en grupos de WhatsApp era contenido de desinformación. Además, las imágenes y los vídeos son más difíciles de someter a verificación que los textos. Aunque los avances en computer vision están empezando a mejorar las capacidades de detección automática, no superan a los filtros de texto. Un estudio de Texas A&M demuestra que en Facebook, la principal fuente de desinformación no son artículos falsos en webs externas, sino imágenes que circulan directamente en el feed.

En Nepal, según el Center for Media Research (CMR-Nepal), entre marzo de 2020 y julio de 2024 se publicaron 408 informes de verificación de datos sobre informaciones erróneas. El 56% de esa desinformación se originó en redes sociales, mientras que un 36% procedía de medios impresos u online. Una encuesta de 2021 del propio CMR-Nepal concluyó que nueve de cada 10 usuarios de redes sociales habían recibido desinformación en la última semana, principalmente a través de Facebook, YouTube y X. Durante las recientes protestas, la propagación de rumores confirmó la magnitud del problema: circularon versiones falsas sobre el vandalismo del templo de Pashupatinath, sobre supuestas demandas de declarar Nepal un Estado hindú y sobre el incendio de la casa de la esposa de un ex primer ministro. Algunos usuarios llegaron a difundir direcciones privadas de líderes políticos, lo que derivó en amenazas y ataques, una práctica conocida como doxxing.

2.3. Efimeridad política

Las plataformas reproducen el presentismo del ciclo de 24 horas, generando picos de atención que rara vez se sostienen en el tiempo. Aunque las redes amplifican y facilitan la coordinación inmediata, dificultan mantener el foco en problemas estructurales.

Sin continuidad, las protestas digitales tienden a disolverse en una sucesión de episodios sin hilo conductor. La efimeridad, en este sentido, erosiona la capacidad de traducir la energía de la calle digital en estructuras políticas estables.

En la India, el movimiento feminista tras el caso de la violación en grupo en Delhi en 2012 mostró el enorme poder de las redes sociales para canalizar indignación y convocar a cientos de miles de personas a las calles. Años más tarde, hashtags como #MeTooIndia lograron visibilizar testimonios y abrir debates públicos antes inexistentes. Sin embargo, diversos estudios han documentado que esta energía inicial tendió a diluirse con rapidez: el ciclo de atención en redes se concentraba en unos pocos días o semanas, mientras que los cambios sostenidos dependieron más de reformas institucionales y de la acción organizada de colectivos civiles que de la conversación digital. Este patrón explica por qué figuras como Natasha Badhwar, co-curadora de Genderlog (una web colaborativa sobre violencia de género en la India), prefería publicar primero un blog reflexivo o una columna periodística antes de trasladar el debate a Twitter.

3. Posibles señales de cambio

Es en los usos cotidianos de la tecnología donde se construyen las redes que, en momentos de crisis, pueden adquirir un papel político inesperado. Las redes sociales deben entenderse como una esfera pública digital. En Nepal vimos un caso excepcional, que, si bien no revierte la tendencia dominante, sí ofrece señales que merece la pena seguir de cerca.

3.1. Nuevas conectividades

Varios gobiernos avanzan hacia modelos de internet más centralizados, con pasarelas nacionales que concentran el control del tráfico y facilitan bloqueos y vigilancia, de manera similar al modelo chino. En 2023, Nepal aprobó una política de ciberseguridad que contempla un National Internet Gateway, pensado para centralizar el acceso a la red y ejercer mayor control estatal. ¿Qué alternativas existen?

3.1.1. La revolución de Bluetooth y las redes mesh

El Bluetooth es una tecnología que parecía haber agotado sus usos, pero ha encontrado un nuevo papel en contextos de crisis: ofrecer comunicación resiliente frente a bloqueos y apagones. Las redes mesh permiten que cada dispositivo actúe como un nodo, transmitiendo datos al siguiente, de manera que no se necesita una torre de telecomunicaciones ni un servidor central. Tu propio teléfono sirve para conectar a otros usuarios cercanos y, sumando nodos, se crea una malla capaz de sostener la comunicación, aunque no haya internet.

En Nepal, esta posibilidad se materializó con Bitchat, una aplicación de mensajería creada en un fin de semana por un pequeño grupo de desarrolladores, entre ellos Jack Dorsey, fundador de Twitter. La app registró más de 48.000 descargas en pocos días, al permitir mensajería local mediante Bluetooth sin necesidad de números de teléfono ni conexión a la red.

Algo similar ocurrió en las protestas de Hong Kong en 2019, donde AirDrop, la función de Apple para compartir archivos entre dispositivos cercanos, se convirtió en una herramienta clave para distribuir mensajes y panfletos sin depender de internet. Esa capacidad de eludir tanto la censura como los apagones se redujo posteriormente, cuando Apple introdujo en China una actualización que limitaba la recepción abierta de AirDrop a sólo 10 minutos.

3.1.2. VPN, de ser usadas para esconder acciones ilegales a ganar adopción mundial

Durante años, las redes privadas virtuales (VPN) estuvieron asociadas al anonimato para actividades ilegales. En la última década, su uso se ha extendido como herramienta para proteger la privacidad y esquivar bloqueos. Al cifrar la conexión y redirigirla por servidores externos, permiten ocultar la ubicación del usuario y saltarse bloqueos geográficos o censura gubernamental. En Nepal, tras el bloqueo de septiembre de 2025, las descargas de Proton VPN crecieron un 8.000% en pocos días.

Figura 6. Registros diarios de VPN en Nepal (% de aumento sobre la media)

Este patrón se repite en otros lugares: en Francia, cuando se bloqueó Pornhub, las altas en VPN se dispararon un 1.000%. Y en el resto de Europa, la introducción de medidas de verificación de edad para restringir el acceso de menores a contenidos pornográficos apunta en la misma dirección: un aumento generalizado del uso cotidiano de VPN.

3.2. Diversificación de plataformas

El ecosistema digital en Nepal refleja una fuerte concentración, al igual que en la gran mayoría de países. Según Data Reportal (enero de 2024), había 13,5 millones de usuarios activos de Facebook; 10,85 millones en Facebook Messenger; 3,6 millones en Instagram; 1,5 millones en LinkedIn y 466.100 en X. Esta dependencia de unas pocas plataformas globales convierte a las redes sociales en “choke points”; puntos únicos de control donde un bloqueo o una decisión corporativa puede interrumpir de inmediato la comunicación de millones de personas.

La diversificación de plataformas abriría el camino a un ecosistema menos vulnerable a la censura o a la manipulación centralizada. Lo ideal sería avanzar hacia un panorama donde existan más aplicaciones de nicho, diseñadas para funciones específicas en lugar de plataformas que concentran todas las interacciones sociales. Redes como Letterboxd, para reseñas de películas, o Strava, para compartir hábitos de running son buenos ejemplos de ello.

La otra palanca es la interoperabilidad, entendida como la capacidad de que distintas plataformas se comuniquen entre sí. Unido a la portabilidad del grafo social (la posibilidad de trasladar la propia red de contactos de una aplicación a otra), permitiría que los usuarios mantuvieran sus vínculos sociales, aunque cambien de servicio o una aplicación sea bloqueada.

3.3. Plataformas para la construcción de consensos: Bridging y Balancing

El diseño de la mayoría de las redes sociales está orientado a maximizar la atención a través de feeds. El paso de miles de jóvenes nepaleses a Discord mostró, aunque de forma caótica, que los entornos centrados en la conversación permiten dinámicas diferentes: menos consumo pasivo y más necesidad de debatir y moderar.

La mayoría de los participantes coincidía en rechazar la corrupción, la desigualdad y la élite política del país, lo que permitió acordar la necesidad de un liderazgo alternativo. Pero este consenso también chocó con divisiones históricas profundas. La descentralización territorial, núcleo de la transición de Nepal hacia el federalismo desde 2015, sigue siendo una fuente de tensiones políticas, enredada con clivajes étnicos y regionales. La constitución reconoce tres niveles de gobierno bajo principios de cooperación y coexistencia, pero en la práctica las competencias están plagadas de ambigüedades: los estados reclaman autonomía legislativa, mientras el gobierno federal conserva un fuerte control. Estas disputas reflejan la larga historia de centralización en torno a las élites hindú-brahmán/kshetri de Katmandú frente a las demandas de reconocimiento y autogobierno de comunidades madhesi, janajati o dalit.

La experiencia mostró que las redes centradas en la conversación pueden generar consensos mínimos sobre problemas compartidos, pero también exponen la dificultad de negociar conflictos identitarios y territoriales que atraviesan a la sociedad nepalí desde hace décadas.

Este límite conecta con un problema de temporalidad y de diseño. En Discord, gran parte de la estabilidad dependió de moderadores voluntarios, filtraban mensajes, contenían llamadas a la violencia y organizaban las conversaciones, sin estar preparados para ello. Los moderadores que encontramos en plataformas como Reddit y Discord son agentes políticos informales que garantizan el orden, pero sin reconocimiento institucional.

Frente a estas limitaciones, algunos proyectos han buscado otros marcos de diseño. El más citado es Pol.is, una red social utilizada en Taiwán que incorpora dos principios:

Bridging (tender puentes): consiste en dar más relevancia a los contenidos que reciben apoyo de comunidades distintas. Por ejemplo, si dos grupos ideológicos opuestos coinciden en una afirmación, esa afirmación asciende en la visibilidad.

Balancing (equilibrar): asegura que todas las comunidades relevantes estén representadas en el debate, evitando que voces minoritarias queden invisibilizadas. Esto fomenta un pluralismo interno, incluso dentro de un mismo colectivo.

Los autores del artículo Prosocial Media han propuesto plasmar esta lógica en la interfaz de las plataformas. Su idea es que cada post muestre indicadores de si está actuando como bridging o balancing, acompañado de herramientas para explorar qué subgrupos apoyan o rechazan una afirmación. Este tipo de diseño haría visible la salud de la conversación y daría más peso a los consensos que a los extremos.

¿Qué vendrá después?

En Nepal, los próximos meses se caracterizarán por la inestabilidad y las dudas sobre la legitimidad del proceso. La designación digital de una primera ministra interina no resuelve el problema de fondo, que sí deberán resolver los nuevos liderazgos surgidos de este proceso. Es probable que en los próximos meses se anuncie un calendario para nuevos comicios, junto con reformas constitucionales para responder a las demandas de los manifestantes. Entre las figuras con mayor proyección destaca Balen Shah, alcalde de Katmandú muy popular entre los jóvenes, que rechazó presentarse como primer ministro interino, pero que cuenta con apoyos dentro del movimiento para ser candidato en las próximas elecciones.

El reto para Shah, Karki y otros líderes emergentes es convertir su popularidad en capacidad parlamentaria. Necesitan un partido que presente suficientes candidatos para alcanzar mayoría legislativa. También requieren estructuras militantes en las zonas rurales, donde la logística electoral es más complicada. A esto se suma la fragmentación étnica y lingüística, así como la persistencia de redes patrimonialistas, que obligan a presentar candidatos locales con los que las comunidades se sientan representadas.

En paralelo, se perfila un escenario regional más amplio. Se está produciendo una oleada de protestas lideradas por la juventud en varios países asiáticos como Bangladesh, Indonesia y Sri Lanka. Algunos observadores empiezan a hablar de Primavera Asiática. Como ya vimos en la Primavera Árabe, las redes sociales tienen el potencial de convertir estallidos locales en movimientos transnacionales, facilitando que una protesta en un país inspire y alimente a otras en la región.

Es llamativo comprobar que, de 2012 a hoy, la trayectoria de las plataformas nos ha alejado más de la democracia de lo que nos ha acercado. Entonces se pensaba que las redes sociales podían ampliar el espacio público y reforzar la acción colectiva; hoy prevalece la evidencia de que sus diseños priorizan la fragmentación y el conflicto. No hay razones sólidas para pensar que el diseño actual de las grandes redes pueda mejorar la cohesión social y el funcionamiento democrático.

En los próximos meses será de alto interés revisar las grabaciones de los servidores de Discord para identificar qué dinámicas de moderación, que funcionalidades de Discord y que técnicas y de organización informal funcionaron y cuáles no, con el fin de inspirar a otros países sobre qué prácticas pueden ser útiles y qué errores conviene no repetir.

Este caso confirma que la lógica predominante de las redes sociales (basada en algoritmos de selección de contenido individualizado y la centralidad de lo visual) tiende a fragmentar la conversación pública y a reforzar dinámicas que favorecen efectos estructurales como la polarización, la circulación de desinformación y la efimeridad política, visibles también en el proceso nepalí. El Bluetooth, que parecía una tecnología con sus usos agotados, adquirió en Nepal un papel revolucionario al posibilitar redes mesh capaces de sostener la comunicación sin internet, complementadas por el uso masivo de redes privadas virtuales frente a los bloqueos. Esta experiencia no transforma el papel estructural de las plataformas, pero ofrece señales sobre cómo rediseños orientados al consenso podrían fortalecer la autonomía ciudadana en la esfera pública digital. Análisis[1]: 1. Un caso inédito Nepal vivió en septiembre de 2025 una ola de protestas que sacudió el país y desembocó en la dimisión del primer ministro Khadga Prasad Oli, el incendio de la Asamblea Nacional y la imposición de un toque de queda militar en la capital. Más de 70 personas murieron en los enfrentamientos con la policía, en un estallido social que combinó varios aspectos: la indignación frente a la corrupción y la desigualdad y el rechazo a las medidas de control digital del gobierno. Con las principales redes sociales bloqueadas, decenas de miles de jóvenes trasladaron el debate político a Discord, una aplicación de mensajería asociada al mundo de los videojuegos. En cuestión de días, este espacio se convirtió en una suerte de convención digital donde se discutieron programas y se propuso incluso el nombre de una primera ministra interina, la exmagistrada Sushila Karki. Que una plataforma pensada para la conversación entre gamers se transformara en el escenario central de la política nacional, recibiendo la legitimidad del poder militar, marca un episodio sin precedentes. En el primer semestre del año fiscal 2025, su PIB real creció aproximadamente un 4,9%, pero más del 20% de su población de 30 millones de personas sigue viviendo bajo el umbral de pobreza y el desempleo juvenil se mantiene en torno al 20%. La desigualdad de ingresos, con un índice de Gini cercano a 30 puntos, ha descendido ligeramente respecto a hace una década, aunque persisten fuertes brechas entre áreas urbanas y rurales y entre grupos sociales. La falta de diversificación productiva empuja a gran parte de la población activa a buscar oportunidades en el exterior: alrededor del 7,5% de los nepaleses trabaja fuera del país, principalmente en los Estados del Golfo y Malasia. Como resultado, las remesas equivalen a más de una cuarta parte del PIB y sostienen el consumo interno, aunque al mismo tiempo generan una fuerte dependencia de factores externos y de la estabilidad de los mercados laborales internacionales. Precisamente por estas vulnerabilidades y dependencias, Nepal se ha convertido en un ejemplo de rápida digitalización económica, con una rápida expansión de los pagos electrónicos, como respuesta a la falta de un sistema financiero inclusivo y a la dependencia de las remesas. En este contexto de desigualdad, a mediados de 2025, se viralizaron en TikTok e Instagram vídeos de los llamados #NepoKids, jóvenes pertenecientes a familias políticas y empresariales adineradas que mostraban sus vacaciones en destinos de lujo, coches importados y ropa de marca. Para muchos jóvenes, esos vídeos fueron la chispa que convirtió el malestar acumulado en indignación abierta. El gobierno prohibió 26 redes sociales y aplicaciones de mensajería, entre ellas Facebook, Instagram, YouTube y X. La medida desató una protesta juvenil de dimensiones inéditas, que dejó decenas de muertos y forzó la dimisión del primer ministro. El Parlamento quedó paralizado y el país entró en un vacío de poder. La decisión de bloquear las plataformas se justificó oficialmente por el incumplimiento de un requisito previo de registro en Nepal, impuesto a las grandes tecnológicas meses antes. El gobierno alegó que estas empresas operaban sin supervisión local, lo que representaba un problema de soberanía digital y de control de contenidos. Sin embargo, la prohibición fue percibida como un intento de silenciar la ola de indignación. Tener redes sociales no es un derecho, pero prohibirlas sí supone vulnerar uno, especialmente en países con una gran diáspora como Nepal, donde las redes sociales son el único medio de comunicación con familiares y amigos en el extranjero. La respuesta ciudadana dio entonces un giro inesperado. Discord se convirtió en el principal espacio de deliberación política. Más de 100.000 personas se unieron al servidor Youths Against Corruption, donde se debatieron programas, se presentaron candidaturas y se organizaron votaciones abiertas transmitidas en medios locales. Figura 1. Servidor de Discord en el que se debatió el futuro político del país Fuente: Reddit. De ese proceso emergió como candidata de consenso la exmagistrada Sushila Karki, propuesta que fue reconocida por los líderes militares y por el presidente, quienes aceptaron el resultado como salida legítima a la crisis. Karki fue juramentada como primera ministra interina, convirtiéndose en la primera mujer en ocupar el cargo. Figura 2. Encuesta en Discord en la que se eligió a la nueva primera ministra interina Fuente: @neorohit/X. Este episodio pone sobre la mesa la pregunta: ¿estamos ante una excepción pasajera dentro de la tendencia en la que las redes erosionan la cohesión social y el funcionamiento democrático, o ante el inicio de un cambio de rumbo que podría abrir nuevas posibilidades? 2. La lógica dominante en las redes sociales Este proceso de deliberación digital no debe interpretarse como una transformación estructural del papel político de las plataformas digitales. El patrón dominante (o, en los términos del artículo Prosocial Media, sus “patologías”) sigue siendo otro, muy distinto. Dos rasgos de las redes sociales muestran hasta qué punto el caso de Nepal se inserta en esta lógica dominante: Feeds individualizados mediante algoritmos de ranking. Cada usuario recibe una selección de contenidos distinta, ordenada en función de lo que más interacción genera. Esto fragmenta la experiencia y convierte la conversación política en una secuencia de percepciones aisladas. En Nepal, los jóvenes veían en sus pantallas un flujo constante de símbolos de indignación, como los vídeos de los #NepoKids, que reforzaban la idea de un consenso generalizado contra las élites. Otros segmentos de la población, en cambio, apenas comprendían cuáles eran las fuentes de frustración de la juventud. Figura 3. Vídeo en el que se pide exponer el estilo de vida de los jóvenes de las élites económicas y políticas de Nepal Fuente: TikTok. Primacía de lo visual y lo emocional. Las plataformas como TikTok e Instagram están diseñadas para privilegiar imágenes y vídeos que producen una reacción inmediata. Si las protestas en Nepal llegaron a todos los smartphones del planeta fue por la viralización de escenas como el Parlamento en llamas o los ministros arrojados al río. Figura 4. Vídeo en el que el ministro de Finanzas es arrojado al río, perseguido y agredido Fuente: TikTok. Figura 5. Vídeo del incendio de la Asamblea Nacional, Katmandú Fuente: TikTok. De estos dos elementos de diseño se derivan tres problemas estructurales que no son exclusivos de Nepal, sino la norma en el ecosistema digital contemporáneo. 2.1. Polarización La polarización política mediada por plataformas digitales es un fenómeno ampliamente documentado a nivel global. Los algoritmos de personalización tienden a encerrar a los usuarios en burbujas afines y a dar mayor visibilidad a contenidos extremos. La circulación de memes y mensajes políticos se da sobre todo en comunidades homogéneas, lo cual reduce la exposición a perspectivas divergentes. Por ejemplo, tras la actualización de Facebook en 2018 que priorizó las “interacciones sociales significativas”, encuestas en Italia registraron un aumento de la polarización ideológica y afectiva. Cuando se ponderan más las señales de interacción social (como likes y compartidos), los contenidos extremos escalan con facilidad hasta los primeros puestos de los feeds. El 6 de agosto de 2025, poco más de un mes antes del estallido, Instagram introdujo la función de “repost”, similar a la de TikTok, que permitió la difusión y amplificación rápida de publicaciones. La revista nepalí Himalmag identificó esta novedad como un hito en la cronología de hechos que desembocaron en las protestas. Según Himalmag, la posibilidad de compartir publicaciones de manera instantánea habría facilitado la difusión masiva de memes y mensajes políticos, amplificando la percepción de polarización en un contexto ya marcado por la desconfianza. Un estudio experimental con usuarios de Facebook durante las elecciones estadounidenses de 2020 mostró que eliminar los reshares de los feeds redujo de forma sustancial la exposición a noticias políticas, incluyendo contenidos de baja fiabilidad, ya que el usuario verá preferiblemente el contenido compartido por las personas a las que sigue. También disminuyó el número de clics, reacciones y visitas a noticias partidistas, y produjo un descenso en el nivel de conocimiento político de los usuarios. Sin embargo, el tratamiento no modificó la polarización ideológica ni las actitudes políticas individuales. Las decisiones de diseño de redes sociales deben someterse a pruebas en situaciones electorales, en escenarios de protesta y en la vida cotidiana: stress tests que permitan anticipar sus efectos en distintos contextos políticos y sociales. 2.2. Desinformación La desinformación se ha convertido en un rasgo estructural del ecosistema digital global. Los algoritmos de ranking priorizan los contenidos que generan reacciones inmediatas, lo que favorece la viralidad del contenido falso. En la India, por ejemplo, se constató que alrededor del 13% de las imágenes compartidas en grupos de WhatsApp era contenido de desinformación. Además, las imágenes y los vídeos son más difíciles de someter a verificación que los textos. Aunque los avances en computer vision están empezando a mejorar las capacidades de detección automática, no superan a los filtros de texto. Un estudio de Texas A&M demuestra que en Facebook, la principal fuente de desinformación no son artículos falsos en webs externas, sino imágenes que circulan directamente en el feed. En Nepal, según el Center for Media Research (CMR-Nepal), entre marzo de 2020 y julio de 2024 se publicaron 408 informes de verificación de datos sobre informaciones erróneas. El 56% de esa desinformación se originó en redes sociales, mientras que un 36% procedía de medios impresos u online. Una encuesta de 2021 del propio CMR-Nepal concluyó que nueve de cada 10 usuarios de redes sociales habían recibido desinformación en la última semana, principalmente a través de Facebook, YouTube y X. Durante las recientes protestas, la propagación de rumores confirmó la magnitud del problema: circularon versiones falsas sobre el vandalismo del templo de Pashupatinath, sobre supuestas demandas de declarar Nepal un Estado hindú y sobre el incendio de la casa de la esposa de un ex primer ministro. Algunos usuarios llegaron a difundir direcciones privadas de líderes políticos, lo que derivó en amenazas y ataques, una práctica conocida como doxxing. 2.3. Efimeridad política Las plataformas reproducen el presentismo del ciclo de 24 horas, generando picos de atención que rara vez se sostienen en el tiempo. Aunque las redes amplifican y facilitan la coordinación inmediata, dificultan mantener el foco en problemas estructurales. Sin continuidad, las protestas digitales tienden a disolverse en una sucesión de episodios sin hilo conductor. La efimeridad, en este sentido, erosiona la capacidad de traducir la energía de la calle digital en estructuras políticas estables. En la India, el movimiento feminista tras el caso de la violación en grupo en Delhi en 2012 mostró el enorme poder de las redes sociales para canalizar indignación y convocar a cientos de miles de personas a las calles. Años más tarde, hashtags como #MeTooIndia lograron visibilizar testimonios y abrir debates públicos antes inexistentes. Sin embargo, diversos estudios han documentado que esta energía inicial tendió a diluirse con rapidez: el ciclo de atención en redes se concentraba en unos pocos días o semanas, mientras que los cambios sostenidos dependieron más de reformas institucionales y de la acción organizada de colectivos civiles que de la conversación digital. Este patrón explica por qué figuras como Natasha Badhwar, co-curadora de Genderlog (una web colaborativa sobre violencia de género en la India), prefería publicar primero un blog reflexivo o una columna periodística antes de trasladar el debate a Twitter. 3. Posibles señales de cambio Es en los usos cotidianos de la tecnología donde se construyen las redes que, en momentos de crisis, pueden adquirir un papel político inesperado. Las redes sociales deben entenderse como una esfera pública digital. En Nepal vimos un caso excepcional, que, si bien no revierte la tendencia dominante, sí ofrece señales que merece la pena seguir de cerca. 3.1. Nuevas conectividades Varios gobiernos avanzan hacia modelos de internet más centralizados, con pasarelas nacionales que concentran el control del tráfico y facilitan bloqueos y vigilancia, de manera similar al modelo chino. En 2023, Nepal aprobó una política de ciberseguridad que contempla un National Internet Gateway, pensado para centralizar el acceso a la red y ejercer mayor control estatal. ¿Qué alternativas existen? 3.1.1. La revolución de Bluetooth y las redes mesh El Bluetooth es una tecnología que parecía haber agotado sus usos, pero ha encontrado un nuevo papel en contextos de crisis: ofrecer comunicación resiliente frente a bloqueos y apagones. Las redes mesh permiten que cada dispositivo actúe como un nodo, transmitiendo datos al siguiente, de manera que no se necesita una torre de telecomunicaciones ni un servidor central. Tu propio teléfono sirve para conectar a otros usuarios cercanos y, sumando nodos, se crea una malla capaz de sostener la comunicación, aunque no haya internet. En Nepal, esta posibilidad se materializó con Bitchat, una aplicación de mensajería creada en un fin de semana por un pequeño grupo de desarrolladores, entre ellos Jack Dorsey, fundador de Twitter. La app registró más de 48.000 descargas en pocos días, al permitir mensajería local mediante Bluetooth sin necesidad de números de teléfono ni conexión a la red. Algo similar ocurrió en las protestas de Hong Kong en 2019, donde AirDrop, la función de Apple para compartir archivos entre dispositivos cercanos, se convirtió en una herramienta clave para distribuir mensajes y panfletos sin depender de internet. Esa capacidad de eludir tanto la censura como los apagones se redujo posteriormente, cuando Apple introdujo en China una actualización que limitaba la recepción abierta de AirDrop a sólo 10 minutos. 3.1.2. VPN, de ser usadas para esconder acciones ilegales a ganar adopción mundial Durante años, las redes privadas virtuales (VPN) estuvieron asociadas al anonimato para actividades ilegales. En la última década, su uso se ha extendido como herramienta para proteger la privacidad y esquivar bloqueos. Al cifrar la conexión y redirigirla por servidores externos, permiten ocultar la ubicación del usuario y saltarse bloqueos geográficos o censura gubernamental. En Nepal, tras el bloqueo de septiembre de 2025, las descargas de Proton VPN crecieron un 8.000% en pocos días. Figura 6. Registros diarios de VPN en Nepal (% de aumento sobre la media) Fuente: gráfico compartido por Proton AG, compañía suiza proveedora de Proton VPN. Este patrón se repite en otros lugares: en Francia, cuando se bloqueó Pornhub, las altas en VPN se dispararon un 1.000%. Y en el resto de Europa, la introducción de medidas de verificación de edad para restringir el acceso de menores a contenidos pornográficos apunta en la misma dirección: un aumento generalizado del uso cotidiano de VPN. 3.2. Diversificación de plataformas El ecosistema digital en Nepal refleja una fuerte concentración, al igual que en la gran mayoría de países. Según Data Reportal (enero de 2024), había 13,5 millones de usuarios activos de Facebook; 10,85 millones en Facebook Messenger; 3,6 millones en Instagram; 1,5 millones en LinkedIn y 466.100 en X. Esta dependencia de unas pocas plataformas globales convierte a las redes sociales en “choke points”; puntos únicos de control donde un bloqueo o una decisión corporativa puede interrumpir de inmediato la comunicación de millones de personas. La diversificación de plataformas abriría el camino a un ecosistema menos vulnerable a la censura o a la manipulación centralizada. Lo ideal sería avanzar hacia un panorama donde existan más aplicaciones de nicho, diseñadas para funciones específicas en lugar de plataformas que concentran todas las interacciones sociales. Redes como Letterboxd, para reseñas de películas, o Strava, para compartir hábitos de running son buenos ejemplos de ello. La otra palanca es la interoperabilidad, entendida como la capacidad de que distintas plataformas se comuniquen entre sí. Unido a la portabilidad del grafo social (la posibilidad de trasladar la propia red de contactos de una aplicación a otra), permitiría que los usuarios mantuvieran sus vínculos sociales, aunque cambien de servicio o una aplicación sea bloqueada. 3.3. Plataformas para la construcción de consensos: Bridging y Balancing El diseño de la mayoría de las redes sociales está orientado a maximizar la atención a través de feeds. El paso de miles de jóvenes nepaleses a Discord mostró, aunque de forma caótica, que los entornos centrados en la conversación permiten dinámicas diferentes: menos consumo pasivo y más necesidad de debatir y moderar. La mayoría de los participantes coincidía en rechazar la corrupción, la desigualdad y la élite política del país, lo que permitió acordar la necesidad de un liderazgo alternativo. Pero este consenso también chocó con divisiones históricas profundas. La descentralización territorial, núcleo de la transición de Nepal hacia el federalismo desde 2015, sigue siendo una fuente de tensiones políticas, enredada con clivajes étnicos y regionales. La constitución reconoce tres niveles de gobierno bajo principios de cooperación y coexistencia, pero en la práctica las competencias están plagadas de ambigüedades: los estados reclaman autonomía legislativa, mientras el gobierno federal conserva un fuerte control. Estas disputas reflejan la larga historia de centralización en torno a las élites hindú-brahmán/kshetri de Katmandú frente a las demandas de reconocimiento y autogobierno de comunidades madhesi, janajati o dalit. La experiencia mostró que las redes centradas en la conversación pueden generar consensos mínimos sobre problemas compartidos, pero también exponen la dificultad de negociar conflictos identitarios y territoriales que atraviesan a la sociedad nepalí desde hace décadas. Este límite conecta con un problema de temporalidad y de diseño. En Discord, gran parte de la estabilidad dependió de moderadores voluntarios, filtraban mensajes, contenían llamadas a la violencia y organizaban las conversaciones, sin estar preparados para ello. Los moderadores que encontramos en plataformas como Reddit y Discord son agentes políticos informales que garantizan el orden, pero sin reconocimiento institucional. Frente a estas limitaciones, algunos proyectos han buscado otros marcos de diseño. El más citado es Pol.is, una red social utilizada en Taiwán que incorpora dos principios: Bridging (tender puentes): consiste en dar más relevancia a los contenidos que reciben apoyo de comunidades distintas. Por ejemplo, si dos grupos ideológicos opuestos coinciden en una afirmación, esa afirmación asciende en la visibilidad. Balancing (equilibrar): asegura que todas las comunidades relevantes estén representadas en el debate, evitando que voces minoritarias queden invisibilizadas. Esto fomenta un pluralismo interno, incluso dentro de un mismo colectivo. Los autores del artículo Prosocial Media han propuesto plasmar esta lógica en la interfaz de las plataformas. Su idea es que cada post muestre indicadores de si está actuando como bridging o balancing, acompañado de herramientas para explorar qué subgrupos apoyan o rechazan una afirmación. Este tipo de diseño haría visible la salud de la conversación y daría más peso a los consensos que a los extremos. Figura 7. Propuesta de interfaz prosocial Fuente: Prosocial Media.

WhatsApp is a key medium for the spread of news and rumors, often shared as images. We study a large collection of politically-oriented WhatsApp groups in India, focusing on the period leading up to the 2019 Indian national elections. By labeling samples of random and popular images, we find that around 10% of shared images are known misinformation and most fall into three types of images. Machine learning methods can be used to predict whether a viral image is misinformation, but are brittle to shifts in content over time.

What are common types of images carrying misinformation?

How robustly can we detect image-based misinformation with machine learning methods? Essay Summary We collected a large dataset of images from thousands of public WhatsApp groups in India. We annotated a sample of these images with the help of journalists.

Based on this annotation, we find that image misinformation is highly prevalent on WhatsApp public groups, making up 13% of all images shared on these groups.

We quantify how images are being used to spread misinformation by categorizing the types of image misinformation, finding three main classes: images taken out of context, photoshopped images, and memes.

Based on our findings, we developed machine learning models to detect misinformation. While the results can sometimes appear promising, these models are not robust to changes over time.

This is the first work to study misinformation on WhatsApp and in the form of images at scale. Given the increasing importance of WhatsApp and other encrypted messaging services in our lives, such findings help in developing technology and policy.

Implications

While group messaging services—most notably WhatsApp—clearly provide value to billions of people, misinformation spreading there has been the proximal cause of social unrest and violence. However, it has been difficult to systematically study misinformation on WhatsApp because of the semi-closed nature of the platform; thus, there is a substantial gap in our knowledge of the prevalence, typology, and detectability of misinformation on WhatsApp. Also, given that a large fraction of the messages shared on WhatsApp are images, understanding the prevalence of misinformation in such modalities is an important task. This paper tackles several novel problems, each of which have their own challenges.

Challenges in obtaining data

Collecting and characterizing data at the scale we did is not trivial. Our data consist of publicly shared WhatsApp messages, specific to India, and hence are subject to various biases. We may be missing, e.g., fringe, extreme content, which might not be discussed in open groups. There are likewise important ethical considerations in obtaining such data, for which there are no agreed upon norms in the research community. Nonetheless, this new data allows us to better study the prevalence of image misinformation, and macro patterns of coordination across groups.

Challenges in annotation

We worked with journalists to annotate a sample of images, which included over 800 misinformation images. We estimate that approximately 13% of image shares in our dataset are misinformation. The annotation of image misinformation is challenging in large part because it needs expertise in fact checking and an image can be misinformation or not based on the context in which it was shared and the time when it was shared.

We built special interfaces to enable the annotation that include context while protecting the privacy of the users. However, our annotation only covers a very small subset (0.1%) of all the images in our dataset, though we oversampled highly shared images. Even with such a small set, the annotations help in the characterization of the types of misinformation images, which in turn helps us understand the underlying motivations and potential methods to prevent the spread of such misinformation.

Challenges in detecting image misinformation

We characterize the prominent types of image misinformation and find that three categories of images make up almost 70% of misinformation shared in our dataset. Of those, detecting out-of-context images might be feasible using existing state-of-the-art techniques. We can easily recover images which are near duplicates, and can identify if an image has been shared in the past and flag images for potential misinformation if shared out of context. Identifying photoshopped images is hard, even manually (Nightingale et al. 2017). State-of-the-art image processing techniques exist to detect manipulated JPEG images (Wu et al. 2019). We tried using these techniques to identify if an image has been digitally manipulated, but these tools were not particularly useful here. These tools confuse genuine photoshopped images with memes, which are also “doctored” in a sense, with someone adding a piece of text or a color when creating a meme.

We also found that misinformation images have certain peculiar characteristics, in terms of their sharing and spreading characteristics compared to non-misinformation images (cf. Vosoughi et al. 2018, Friggeri et al. 2014). We trained machine learning models to identify misinformation and show that though most models do better than a random guess, they are not close to being deployable. Notably, we find that content-based classifiers are not robust to the choice of training data, with performance degrading across time periods.

What next?

How do the insights presented in this paper make a difference? Firstly, the typology of image misinformation and the insights presented in our paper will be helpful to regulators, technology companies, civic campaigners, and those interested in media literacy and political communication. There are three main stakeholders in solving the issue of misinformation.

(i) Technology: We find that old images taken out-of-context do constitute a large fraction of image-based misinformation. Using this finding, a simple feasible technical solution to tackle part of the problem is to create a common repository of old images and fact-checked images, which could be queried to check if an image was already shared in the past. Our machine learning models to detect image misinformation also show promise, indicating that there is scope for automated classifiers.

(ii) Users: One important missing piece in our work is to understand why users share misinformation. More qualitative (e.g., Banaji & Bhat 2019) and psychological (e.g., Pennycook & Rand 2019) studies are needed to understand the why. These studies could be used to educate users and to develop interventions to solve the problem of users encountering misinformation. This could include, for instance, labeling misinformation which has already been fact checked and/or preventing their further spread.

(iii) Platforms: Ultimately, since WhatsApp is a closed platform, any technique that is developed to detect and debunk misinformation can only be implemented by WhatsApp/Facebook, which should build tools necessary to help users identify misinformation effectively.

After all, there may not be a concrete solution just based on one of these three stakeholders that solves the misinformation problem. A more plausible solution could be a mix of technical, social and policy based ideas.

Findings

Finding 1: Image misinformation is highly prevalent in public political WhatsApp groups.

In order to understand the problem of image misinformation, we had 2,500 images manually annotated by three independent journalists. The 2,500 images consists of two sets: (i) a random sample of 500 images taken from our 1.6 million images (random), and (ii) a set of 2,000 most shared images from our data (popular). We sampled these two sets differently in order to get a sense of the underlying distribution of misinformation in the rest of the dataset. We asked the annotators to select from 4 options: 1. Misinformation, 2. Not misinformation, 3. Misinformation already fact checked, 4. Needs concrete fact checking (unclear) (see Methods for details). We also grouped together similar images into clusters, using an image hashing technique that identifies perceptually similar images (Klinger & Starkweather 2010).

First, we compute the prevalence of the various types of misinformation in both the samples (popular and random) and populations of interest. The first two columns of Table 1 show simple proportions of the two types of labeled samples given each majority label. As might be expected, previously fact-checked misinformation is much more common among the most popular images (that is, image clusters), compared with the random sample. In order to estimate the prevalence of these types of images in the broader set of images in the monitored groups, we used standard inverse probability weighting (IPW) estimators and associated standard errors that are widely used in survey sampling to estimate these proportions (Särndal et al. 2003, Lumley 2004). First, we can estimate prevalence among all unique images (i.e., image clusters). Because this gives equal weight to all images, the results are very similar to the random sample. We find that approximately 10% of image shares are obviously (to journalists) misinformation, with 3% more being misinformation that has been previously fact-checked. Clearly, misinformation makes up a substantial portion (13%) of all image sharing in these political groups, even if we are unable to conclusively label many images as misinformation or not.

Image type popular random clusters shares Fact checked misinfo 7.0 (0.6) 2.6 (0.7) 2.6 (0.9) 3.2 (0.7) Misinfo 18.8 (0.9) 10.7 (1.4) 9.3 (1.5) 11.1 (1.2) Not misinfo 39.4 (1.2) 43.5 (2.2) 46.2 (2.6) 43.5 (2.1) Unclear 34.9 (1.1) 43.3 (2.2) 41.8 (2.6) 42.2 (2.1) Table 1. Prevalence (%) of image types. The first two columns are for the two samples of labeled images. The second two use sampling weights to estimate prevalence in the population of all unique image clusters and the population of image shares. The latter uses post-stratification on percentiles of the number of times shared. Standard errors are given in parentheses.

Finding 2: Most image misinformation falls into three categories: old images taken out of context, memes and photoshopped images.

Qualitative analysis of the image types reveals that the misinformation covers a wide spectrum of images including historic & religious myths, nationalism and political memes. Many images convey a sense of immediacy, and shock value (violent/graphic images) which makes them spread faster. We created a typology of the various types of image based misinformation.

This will help us understand the different types of deception used.

Based on manual coding, we were able to identify 3 main types of images:

(i) Old images that are taken out of context and reshared,

(ii) images which are manipulated/edited,

(iii) memes – funny, yet misleading images, containing incorrect stats or quotes, and,

(iv) other types of fake images, consisting of health scares, fake alerts, superstitions, etc.

We should note that this is not an exhaustive list of categories and could be specific to our dataset.

We find that old images that are taken out of context, also termed cheap or shallow fakes (Paris & Donovan 2019) make up roughly 34% of our misinformation image dataset. The next popular category is memes with fake quotes or statistics which make up 30% of the images, followed by simple doctored (i.e., photoshopped) images, which make up roughly 10% of the images. Note that just the top three categories of misinformation constitute over 70% of the images. Examples of each category of such images is shown in Figure 1. This characterization is similar to the qualitative characterization by (Hemsley & Snyder, 2018). Note: The images in the image manipulation category were deceptively manipulated to appear real. For instance, the image in Figure 1 (top, center) is a manipulated image of a TV news program. It is factually incorrect, but more importantly, it has been deceptively edited to appear real. By memes, we mean images which have factually incorrect text overlaid or a combination of image and text which when looked at together conveys factually incorrect information. These are not deceptively edited.

The characterization of the images presented above helps us in two ways:

(i) To understand the motives behind posting. For instance, note that out of these three major types, two of them—photoshopped images and creating memes—require concerted effort to do at scale.

(ii) To develop automated techniques to identify misinformation in images. For instance, the out-of-context images are easy to detect using image hashing techniques, if they make use of images that appear in a database of content already shared in the past. Similarly, advances in computer vision techniques (Wu et al. 2019) and image processing (Lee & Osindero 2016) to identify text in images can be used to detect manipulated images. Since each of these types make up a significant portion of the misinformation, even trying to identify a subset of such images automatically would be immensely helpful.

(LEFT, TOP/BOTTOM) IMAGES TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT — BOTH THESE ARE OLD IMAGES CLAIMED TO BE A RESULT OF INDIA’S ATTACK ON PAKISTAN; (CENTER) PHOTOSHOPPED IMAGES OF (TOP) DOCTORED SCREENSHOT OF A TV NEWS PROGRAM AND (BOTTOM) A POLITICIAN BROWSING PORN; (RIGHT) FAKE QUOTE BY BILL GATES, AND A FAKE POLL BY BBC.

Finding 3: Automatically identifying misinformation images is non-trivial and brittle.

Next, we try to answer the question: Can we identify whether an image is misinformation or not, based on its contents, how it spreads, where it spreads, and who spreads it? To that end, we built machine learning models based on various features extracted from our data. We also check whether some of the sub-categories of image misinformation presented above are easier to detect automatically.

We consider a binary classification task of predicting if an image is misinformation or not. For this task, we create a wide range of features (i.e., predictors), which primarily come under two categories: (i) image metadata features: how it spreads, where and when it spreads, and who spreads it, etc., and (ii) image content features: properties inherent to the content of the image. See the Methods section for details on the features. We compare between three sets: misinfo (misinformation images labeled by experts), not misinfo (images labeled specifically as not misinformation by experts), and random (randomly sampled unlabeled images).

Table 2 shows the accuracy of a classifier making use of just metadata features. A random prediction would give an accuracy of 0.5.

We make a few observations:

Detecting misinformation images from random images is easier, with a much higher accuracy; Even for not misinfo, most features perform slightly better than random, with the web entities feature outperforming the others; Combination of all the features does not improve the performance much. These numbers indicate that there is a weak signal in the way misinformation images spread, being posted in a certain set of groups by a certain set of users.

Misinfo vs. Not Misinfo Misinfo vs. Random Groups 0.65 0.82 Users 0.65 0.78 Time 0.57 0.77 Web domains 0.59 0.75 Web entities 0.72 0.84 Overall 0.67 0.85 Table 2. Classification using metadata features.

Next, we compare the performance of our models built using features extracted from the content of the image. These features were extracted using computer vision techniques and other publicly available tools like the Google Cloud Vision API to extract objects and faces from the image. The best accuracy we could obtain from this task was just slightly better than random (accuracy 0.57, 0.71 for misinfo vs. not misinfo and vs. random respectively). On the other hand, a state of the art deep learning model (pre-trained ResNext model) performs very well, even reaching over 0.95 in some cases.

To ensure that the results we obtained are robust, we split the images into different sets based on when they were shared. We find that when testing on images with different time periods, metadata features are robust and do not change much irrespective of what the training/test dataset is. However, on the other hand, image content related features are fragile and have quite a bit of variance, going as low as 0.55 from 0.95. A lot of work in the area of predicting “fake news” regularly reports over 85% accuracy (Gupta et al. 2013; Monti et al. 2019; Khattar et al. 2019). Our results indicate the importance of testing the robustness of such approaches, especially for black box models.

Finally, we checked whether our machine learning models are better at identifying the three major types of image misinformation: out-of-context images, memes, and manipulated images. We find that identifying out-of-context images works better by using the web domains feature with an accuracy of 0.78 for the misinfo vs. not misinfo task (compared to 0.59 for all the images). This is expected since this feature captures where else on the web this image appeared in the past, and out-of-context images are typically more likely to have appeared in low quality or fact checking websites, which makes them easily discernible. We do not observe any significant differences in accuracy for detecting manipulated images or memes, even using features specific to those images, whether features from a recent paper that detects potentially manipulated pixels (Wu et al. 2019) or features about text in the image (see Methods).

Methods

Data collection

Our analysis relies on a large dataset that we obtained from public groups on WhatsApp . Specifically, we focus on public groups discussing Indian politics. Lists of such public groups are advertised through dedicated websites and social media. The use of public groups has become a de facto way for political parties to reach a new audience, who are only available through WhatsApp. Surveys have shown that such groups are very popular in India (Lokniti 2018) and Brazil (Newman et al. 2019). We obtained groups related to politics in India by manually searching for keywords related to all major national & regional political parties and religious groups and their prominent political leaders, looking for data on Facebook, Twitter and Google. All the related chat.whatsapp.com links that were obtained were then manually screened and we removed any link that was not deemed to be politically relevant.

We joined and obtained data from over 5,000 political groups using the tools provided by (Garimella & Tyson 2018). From these groups, we obtained all the text messages, images, video and audio shared in the groups. For each group, we also know the members of the group, and the admin(s) of the group. We collected over 5 million messages shared by over 250,000 users over a period of 9 months, from October 2018 to June 2019. Given high profile events such as the Indian national election, India/Pakistan tensions, etc, data from political groups during this period is extremely insightful. The data covers all the major national and regional parties, and affiliated religious groups, with over 10 languages represented. Roughly half of the content is in Hindi, followed by English, Telugu and other regional languages. Roughly 41% of the data is text, 35% images, and 17% video. In this paper, we only focus on images, since images were a dominant modality of information sharing on WhatsApp. In total, our dataset consists of 1.6 million images.

An important point to note about our data is the biases in sampling the groups. Since WhatsApp does not provide a way to search available groups, it is difficult to estimate the bias in our sample. A large fraction of the groups in our data (24.4%) apparently belong to the BJP (the party currently in power) and other unofficial religious groups loosely supporting the BJP. We could not find many groups from the main opposition party, Indian National Congress, which only accounts for 5% of the groups in our data. This bias could just reflect the lack of a coordinated WhatsApp strategy for the Congress . Also note that given this bias in sampling, the results from our analysis (e.g. prevalence of misinformation images) are only applicable to this dataset and may not generalize to the broader WhatsApp population.

Annotating the images for misinformation

We manually annotated a sample of 2,500 images with the help of three professional journalists. The journalists are experts in fact checking and regularly report on digital platforms. The 2,500 images were chosen to contain both a random sample of 500 images, and a set of 2,000 popular (most shared) images from our data. This effectively oversamples popular images while also enabling estimating prevalence in the full set of images. We built an annotation portal specifically for the journalists to view and annotate the images. Figure 2 shows the annotation portal. The portal shows an image and the annotators select from a set of four available options. Tools to check the image in the chat context in which it was shared, and to reverse image search were provided.

The annotators had the following instructions: For each image, first check if it has already been fact checked by clicking on the `Image Reverse Search’ option to check where it has appeared on the web (using Google reverse image search). If you find the image already fact checked to be false in popular fact checking sites, please report where it was fact checked. If the image has not appeared on the web and is hard to fact check quickly, please mark the 4th option, needs concrete fact checking. If not, do you know if the image contains obvious misinformation (or not)? If it is not clear, first click on the `View Context’ button, to show the image in the chat context along with the text with which it was shared (Figure 2a).

Figure 2 . (A) ANNOTATION PORTAL USED FOR ANNOTATING MISINFORMATION IMAGES, (B) IMAGE SHOWN IN THE CHAT CONTEXT IN WHICH IT WAS SHARED.

We asked the annotators to select from four options: 1. Obviously not misinformation 2. Obvious misinformation 3. Already fact checked to be false 4. Needs concrete fact checking. The annotators could select only one option. In case an image is both misinformation and is fact checked, they selected the latter. The design of the options was due to the following considerations: a. We wanted to get a sense of the fraction of images that were already fact checked, b. Fact checking is an extremely time consuming operation for certain cases, and since we employed professional journalists, we could not ask them to spend a lot of time on each image, given that they had to annotate 2,500 images. So we gave them option 4 above, which they were asked to select only if they were highly uncertain.

For getting a dataset of misinformation images, we combine the obvious misinformation and fact checked to false categories. The inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss’ Kappa) for the three annotators and three classes (misinformation/not misinformation and needs concrete fact checking) is 0.42 indicating a moderate level of agreement. In most cases, the disagreement comes from labeling (not) misinformation as needs concrete fact checking. The Fleiss Kappa for just the two classes (misinformation/not) is 0.78. In order to make sure that our final labeled dataset is of high quality, we did not consider the small set of cases with obvious disagreement (one journalist labeling it as misinformation while the other not). This gave us 605 images which were annotated to be false.

Fact checked images

We also collected images which were fact checked on popular fact checking websites from India . By scraping all the images present on these websites, we obtained close to 20,000 images. By matching the images from fact checking websites to the millions of images from our WhatsApp dataset using image matching techniques, we can find examples of fact checked images in our data. To do this, we used state of the art image matching techniques developed and being used at Facebook . The matching works by computing a 256-bit hash for each image. The hashing is done using a technique called perceptual hashing, which can detect near similar images, even if cropped differently or having small amounts of text overlaid. This gave us roughly 200 images which were fact checked to be false. We combined this with the above set manually labeled by us to obtain our final set of misinformation images.

Image clustering

Though images are hard to manipulate, we observe many instances of similar images with slight changes (e.g. see Figure 3) in our dataset. To combine variants of a similar image, we used the same image hashing algorithm (Facebook PDQ) to obtain hashes, and cluster the hashes together using the DBSCAN clustering algorithm (Esteret et al. 1996). This step ensures that we group together images which have similar content, and hence consider all variants of the image as a single cluster. A similar technique was used by (Zannettou et al. 2018) to measure the spread of memes in the US. Next, for a given annotated misinformation image, we include all the variants of images which were clustered together with the image as potential misinformation. This gave us around 40 thousand image instances corresponding to the 800 clusters, shared by over 13 thousand users.

Prevalence estimation

Note that we only annotated 2,500 images (2000 popular, and 500 random) from our entire dataset of millions of images. In order to estimate the prevalence of these types of images in the broader set of images in the monitored groups, we combine these samples for estimation and inference. In particular, the combined sample has positive (but heterogeneous) probability of including any image, so we can use standard inverse probability weighting (IPW) estimators and associated standard errors that are widely used in survey sampling to estimate these proportions (Särndal et al. 2003, Lumley 2004). More interestingly, we can also estimate prevalence among image shares, which reflects the chance that a random image share is of each type. For these estimates, we additionally post-stratify on percentiles of number of image shares to increase precision.

Machine learning models

To detect whether an image contains misinformation or not, we built machine learning models based on various features extracted from our data. The features can be grouped into two types: (i) Metadata features, which look at only information about the spread of the image in our data, and (ii) content features, which look at the content of the images. The class distribution is balanced using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (Chawla et al. 2002). So a random prediction would have an accuracy of 0.5.

Metadata features: We used various types of metadata features of the images such as:

(I) Spread features: (i) Groups in which the images were shared, (ii) users who shared the images, and (iii) how many times the image was shared.

(II) Time features: (i) total time span of the image (difference in days between the first and last share), and (ii) average time between shares (a measure of virality).

(III) Web features: (i) We used reverse Google image search to get a list of domains on which the image appears and used the list of domains as a feature, (ii) We also used the “web entities” end point from the Cloud Vision API , which returns entities found on the web related to the image.

Now we check if there are any differences in the content of the images between the three classes.

We primarily used Google’s Cloud Vision API to process and extract image content features.

Cloud Vision API provides tools to identify objects and text in the image effectively, and works quite well even for non-English text. We obtained the features related to objects, text and faces from the image. Specifically, we extracted the following features:

(I) Safe Search features: detects whether the image contains violence, racy, adult, etc.

(II) Objects features: detects what objects are contained in the image.

(III) Text features: Identifies text in the image (OCR) and if text exists, we create a tf-idf vector of the bag of words from this text.

(IV) Face features: For images with faces, we extract facial features, like whether the person is angry, surprised, smiling, etc.

(V) Color features: Identify the dominant colors in the image.

In addition to the content features from Cloud Vision, we also obtained the fraction of pixels in an image that have been manipulated (Wu et al. 2019) and used a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) trained with Facebook’s ResNext architecture. We used a publicly available model provided by PyTorch pre-trained on ImageNet. The model is trained to predict one of the 1,000 ImageNet classes, given an image. For each image, we just consider the last layer of the model, a 1000-dimensional vector, indicating the probability of the image belonging to one of the 1,000 ImageNet classes as the features. We also included the text that was posted along with the image. To do this, we first obtained Doc2vec embeddings for text before and after the image. This gave us a 200 dimensional feature vector for text before and after each image. We tested multiple classifiers using the above features and chose a Random Forest classifier since it provides the best accuracy. All results reported are the mean of a 10 fold cross validation.

We also tested the classifiers on the three types of image misinformation: images taken out of context, memes and manipulated images. Our expectation was that these features, specifically engineered for a specific type of misinformation would help in detecting that subset of misinformation images. We hypothesize that the following category specific features would work well. (i) Out-of-context images: Web domains. Web domains indicate the domains which are returned on a Google reverse image search for the image. Out-of-context images are typically shared by low quality domains or by domains which might have fact checked the image. Typically such low quality or fact checking domains are not returned for other categories of images, (ii) Manipulated images: We used a state of the art computer vision technique, which detects pixels which might have been manipulated (Wu et al. 2019). From this, we computed the fraction of pixels in an image which could have been manipulated. The intuition was that this fraction would be higher for manipulated images. However, the technique fails in our case since a lot of images which do not fall into this category are also falsely labeled as manipulated (see Figure 4 for an example), and, (iii) Memes: text on the image. Memes contain a lot of text on them. This category mostly contains memes with false quotes and statistics. The idea was that using text related features (e.g. tf-idf vectors), we could identify such false text.",https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/images-and-misinformation-in-political-groups-evidence-from-whatsapp-in-india/,2020-07-08 00:33:47+00:00,"Article Metrics 56 CrossRef Citations 216 PDF Downloads PDF downloads since July 10, 2023 12000 Page Views WhatsApp is a key medium for the spread of news and rumors, often shared as images. We study a large collection of politically-oriented WhatsApp groups in India, focusing on the period leading up to the 2019 Indian national elections. By labeling samples of random and popular images, we find that around 10% of shared images are known misinformation and most fall into three types of images. Machine learning methods can be used to predict whether a viral image is misinformation, but are brittle to shifts in content over time. Image by MIH83 on Pixabay Research Questions How prevalent is image-based misinformation on WhatsApp? What are common types of images carrying misinformation? How robustly can we detect image-based misinformation with machine learning methods? Essay Summary We collected a large dataset of images from thousands of public WhatsApp groups in India. We annotated a sample of these images with the help of journalists. Based on this annotation, we find that image misinformation is highly prevalent on WhatsApp public groups, making up 13% of all images shared on these groups. We quantify how images are being used to spread misinformation by categorizing the types of image misinformation, finding three main classes: images taken out of context, photoshopped images, and memes. Based on our findings, we developed machine learning models to detect misinformation. While the results can sometimes appear promising, these models are not robust to changes over time. This is the first work to study misinformation on WhatsApp and in the form of images at scale. Given the increasing importance of WhatsApp and other encrypted messaging services in our lives, such findings help in developing technology and policy. Implications While group messaging services—most notably WhatsApp—clearly provide value to billions of people, misinformation spreading there has been the proximal cause of social unrest and violence. However, it has been difficult to systematically study misinformation on WhatsApp because of the semi-closed nature of the platform; thus, there is a substantial gap in our knowledge of the prevalence, typology, and detectability of misinformation on WhatsApp. Also, given that a large fraction of the messages shared on WhatsApp are images, understanding the prevalence of misinformation in such modalities is an important task. This paper tackles several novel problems, each of which have their own challenges. Challenges in obtaining data Collecting and characterizing data at the scale we did is not trivial. Our data consist of publicly shared WhatsApp messages, specific to India, and hence are subject to various biases. We may be missing, e.g., fringe, extreme content, which might not be discussed in open groups. There are likewise important ethical considerations in obtaining such data, for which there are no agreed upon norms in the research community. Nonetheless, this new data allows us to better study the prevalence of image misinformation, and macro patterns of coordination across groups. Challenges in annotation We worked with journalists to annotate a sample of images, which included over 800 misinformation images. We estimate that approximately 13% of image shares in our dataset are misinformation. The annotation of image misinformation is challenging in large part because it needs expertise in fact checking and an image can be misinformation or not based on the context in which it was shared and the time when it was shared. We built special interfaces to enable the annotation that include context while protecting the privacy of the users. However, our annotation only covers a very small subset (0.1%) of all the images in our dataset, though we oversampled highly shared images. Even with such a small set, the annotations help in the characterization of the types of misinformation images, which in turn helps us understand the underlying motivations and potential methods to prevent the spread of such misinformation. Challenges in detecting image misinformation We characterize the prominent types of image misinformation and find that three categories of images make up almost 70% of misinformation shared in our dataset. Of those, detecting out-of-context images might be feasible using existing state-of-the-art techniques. We can easily recover images which are near duplicates, and can identify if an image has been shared in the past and flag images for potential misinformation if shared out of context. Identifying photoshopped images is hard, even manually (Nightingale et al. 2017). State-of-the-art image processing techniques exist to detect manipulated JPEG images (Wu et al. 2019). We tried using these techniques to identify if an image has been digitally manipulated, but these tools were not particularly useful here. These tools confuse genuine photoshopped images with memes, which are also “doctored” in a sense, with someone adding a piece of text or a color when creating a meme. We also found that misinformation images have certain peculiar characteristics, in terms of their sharing and spreading characteristics compared to non-misinformation images (cf. Vosoughi et al. 2018, Friggeri et al. 2014). We trained machine learning models to identify misinformation and show that though most models do better than a random guess, they are not close to being deployable. Notably, we find that content-based classifiers are not robust to the choice of training data, with performance degrading across time periods. What next? How do the insights presented in this paper make a difference? Firstly, the typology of image misinformation and the insights presented in our paper will be helpful to regulators, technology companies, civic campaigners, and those interested in media literacy and political communication. There are three main stakeholders in solving the issue of misinformation. (i) Technology: We find that old images taken out-of-context do constitute a large fraction of image-based misinformation. Using this finding, a simple feasible technical solution to tackle part of the problem is to create a common repository of old images and fact-checked images, which could be queried to check if an image was already shared in the past. Our machine learning models to detect image misinformation also show promise, indicating that there is scope for automated classifiers. (ii) Users: One important missing piece in our work is to understand why users share misinformation. More qualitative (e.g., Banaji & Bhat 2019) and psychological (e.g., Pennycook & Rand 2019) studies are needed to understand the why. These studies could be used to educate users and to develop interventions to solve the problem of users encountering misinformation. This could include, for instance, labeling misinformation which has already been fact checked and/or preventing their further spread. (iii) Platforms: Ultimately, since WhatsApp is a closed platform, any technique that is developed to detect and debunk misinformation can only be implemented by WhatsApp/Facebook, which should build tools necessary to help users identify misinformation effectively. After all, there may not be a concrete solution just based on one of these three stakeholders that solves the misinformation problem. A more plausible solution could be a mix of technical, social and policy based ideas. Findings Finding 1: Image misinformation is highly prevalent in public political WhatsApp groups. In order to understand the problem of image misinformation, we had 2,500 images manually annotated by three independent journalists. The 2,500 images consists of two sets: (i) a random sample of 500 images taken from our 1.6 million images (random), and (ii) a set of 2,000 most shared images from our data (popular). We sampled these two sets differently in order to get a sense of the underlying distribution of misinformation in the rest of the dataset. We asked the annotators to select from 4 options: 1. Misinformation, 2. Not misinformation, 3. Misinformation already fact checked, 4. Needs concrete fact checking (unclear) (see Methods for details). We also grouped together similar images into clusters, using an image hashing technique that identifies perceptually similar images (Klinger & Starkweather 2010). First, we compute the prevalence of the various types of misinformation in both the samples (popular and random) and populations of interest. The first two columns of Table 1 show simple proportions of the two types of labeled samples given each majority label. As might be expected, previously fact-checked misinformation is much more common among the most popular images (that is, image clusters), compared with the random sample. In order to estimate the prevalence of these types of images in the broader set of images in the monitored groups, we used standard inverse probability weighting (IPW) estimators and associated standard errors that are widely used in survey sampling to estimate these proportions (Särndal et al. 2003, Lumley 2004). First, we can estimate prevalence among all unique images (i.e., image clusters). Because this gives equal weight to all images, the results are very similar to the random sample. We find that approximately 10% of image shares are obviously (to journalists) misinformation, with 3% more being misinformation that has been previously fact-checked. Clearly, misinformation makes up a substantial portion (13%) of all image sharing in these political groups, even if we are unable to conclusively label many images as misinformation or not. Image type popular random clusters shares Fact checked misinfo 7.0 (0.6) 2.6 (0.7) 2.6 (0.9) 3.2 (0.7) Misinfo 18.8 (0.9) 10.7 (1.4) 9.3 (1.5) 11.1 (1.2) Not misinfo 39.4 (1.2) 43.5 (2.2) 46.2 (2.6) 43.5 (2.1) Unclear 34.9 (1.1) 43.3 (2.2) 41.8 (2.6) 42.2 (2.1) Table 1. Prevalence (%) of image types. The first two columns are for the two samples of labeled images. The second two use sampling weights to estimate prevalence in the population of all unique image clusters and the population of image shares. The latter uses post-stratification on percentiles of the number of times shared. Standard errors are given in parentheses. Finding 2: Most image misinformation falls into three categories: old images taken out of context, memes and photoshopped images. Qualitative analysis of the image types reveals that the misinformation covers a wide spectrum of images including historic & religious myths, nationalism and political memes. Many images convey a sense of immediacy, and shock value (violent/graphic images) which makes them spread faster. We created a typology of the various types of image based misinformation. This will help us understand the different types of deception used. Based on manual coding, we were able to identify 3 main types of images: (i) Old images that are taken out of context and reshared, (ii) images which are manipulated/edited, (iii) memes – funny, yet misleading images, containing incorrect stats or quotes, and, (iv) other types of fake images, consisting of health scares, fake alerts, superstitions, etc. We should note that this is not an exhaustive list of categories and could be specific to our dataset. We find that old images that are taken out of context, also termed cheap or shallow fakes (Paris & Donovan 2019) make up roughly 34% of our misinformation image dataset. The next popular category is memes with fake quotes or statistics which make up 30% of the images, followed by simple doctored (i.e., photoshopped) images, which make up roughly 10% of the images. Note that just the top three categories of misinformation constitute over 70% of the images. Examples of each category of such images is shown in Figure 1. This characterization is similar to the qualitative characterization by (Hemsley & Snyder, 2018). Note: The images in the image manipulation category were deceptively manipulated to appear real. For instance, the image in Figure 1 (top, center) is a manipulated image of a TV news program. It is factually incorrect, but more importantly, it has been deceptively edited to appear real. By memes, we mean images which have factually incorrect text overlaid or a combination of image and text which when looked at together conveys factually incorrect information. These are not deceptively edited. The characterization of the images presented above helps us in two ways: (i) To understand the motives behind posting. For instance, note that out of these three major types, two of them—photoshopped images and creating memes—require concerted effort to do at scale. (ii) To develop automated techniques to identify misinformation in images. For instance, the out-of-context images are easy to detect using image hashing techniques, if they make use of images that appear in a database of content already shared in the past. Similarly, advances in computer vision techniques (Wu et al. 2019) and image processing (Lee & Osindero 2016) to identify text in images can be used to detect manipulated images. Since each of these types make up a significant portion of the misinformation, even trying to identify a subset of such images automatically would be immensely helpful. Figure 1 . TYPES OF MISINFORMATION. (LEFT, TOP/BOTTOM) IMAGES TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT — BOTH THESE ARE OLD IMAGES CLAIMED TO BE A RESULT OF INDIA’S ATTACK ON PAKISTAN; (CENTER) PHOTOSHOPPED IMAGES OF (TOP) DOCTORED SCREENSHOT OF A TV NEWS PROGRAM AND (BOTTOM) A POLITICIAN BROWSING PORN; (RIGHT) FAKE QUOTE BY BILL GATES, AND A FAKE POLL BY BBC. Finding 3: Automatically identifying misinformation images is non-trivial and brittle. Next, we try to answer the question: Can we identify whether an image is misinformation or not, based on its contents, how it spreads, where it spreads, and who spreads it? To that end, we built machine learning models based on various features extracted from our data. We also check whether some of the sub-categories of image misinformation presented above are easier to detect automatically. We consider a binary classification task of predicting if an image is misinformation or not. For this task, we create a wide range of features (i.e., predictors), which primarily come under two categories: (i) image metadata features: how it spreads, where and when it spreads, and who spreads it, etc., and (ii) image content features: properties inherent to the content of the image. See the Methods section for details on the features. We compare between three sets: misinfo (misinformation images labeled by experts), not misinfo (images labeled specifically as not misinformation by experts), and random (randomly sampled unlabeled images). Table 2 shows the accuracy of a classifier making use of just metadata features. A random prediction would give an accuracy of 0.5. We make a few observations: Detecting misinformation images from random images is easier, with a much higher accuracy; Even for not misinfo, most features perform slightly better than random, with the web entities feature outperforming the others; Combination of all the features does not improve the performance much. These numbers indicate that there is a weak signal in the way misinformation images spread, being posted in a certain set of groups by a certain set of users. Misinfo vs. Not Misinfo Misinfo vs. Random Groups 0.65 0.82 Users 0.65 0.78 Time 0.57 0.77 Web domains 0.59 0.75 Web entities 0.72 0.84 Overall 0.67 0.85 Table 2. Classification using metadata features. Next, we compare the performance of our models built using features extracted from the content of the image. These features were extracted using computer vision techniques and other publicly available tools like the Google Cloud Vision API to extract objects and faces from the image. The best accuracy we could obtain from this task was just slightly better than random (accuracy 0.57, 0.71 for misinfo vs. not misinfo and vs. random respectively). On the other hand, a state of the art deep learning model (pre-trained ResNext model) performs very well, even reaching over 0.95 in some cases. To ensure that the results we obtained are robust, we split the images into different sets based on when they were shared. We find that when testing on images with different time periods, metadata features are robust and do not change much irrespective of what the training/test dataset is. However, on the other hand, image content related features are fragile and have quite a bit of variance, going as low as 0.55 from 0.95. A lot of work in the area of predicting “fake news” regularly reports over 85% accuracy (Gupta et al. 2013; Monti et al. 2019; Khattar et al. 2019). Our results indicate the importance of testing the robustness of such approaches, especially for black box models. Finally, we checked whether our machine learning models are better at identifying the three major types of image misinformation: out-of-context images, memes, and manipulated images. We find that identifying out-of-context images works better by using the web domains feature with an accuracy of 0.78 for the misinfo vs. not misinfo task (compared to 0.59 for all the images). This is expected since this feature captures where else on the web this image appeared in the past, and out-of-context images are typically more likely to have appeared in low quality or fact checking websites, which makes them easily discernible. We do not observe any significant differences in accuracy for detecting manipulated images or memes, even using features specific to those images, whether features from a recent paper that detects potentially manipulated pixels (Wu et al. 2019) or features about text in the image (see Methods). Methods Data collection Our analysis relies on a large dataset that we obtained from public groups on WhatsApp . Specifically, we focus on public groups discussing Indian politics. Lists of such public groups are advertised through dedicated websites and social media. The use of public groups has become a de facto way for political parties to reach a new audience, who are only available through WhatsApp. Surveys have shown that such groups are very popular in India (Lokniti 2018) and Brazil (Newman et al. 2019). We obtained groups related to politics in India by manually searching for keywords related to all major national & regional political parties and religious groups and their prominent political leaders, looking for data on Facebook, Twitter and Google. All the related chat.whatsapp.com links that were obtained were then manually screened and we removed any link that was not deemed to be politically relevant. We joined and obtained data from over 5,000 political groups using the tools provided by (Garimella & Tyson 2018). From these groups, we obtained all the text messages, images, video and audio shared in the groups. For each group, we also know the members of the group, and the admin(s) of the group. We collected over 5 million messages shared by over 250,000 users over a period of 9 months, from October 2018 to June 2019. Given high profile events such as the Indian national election, India/Pakistan tensions, etc, data from political groups during this period is extremely insightful. The data covers all the major national and regional parties, and affiliated religious groups, with over 10 languages represented. Roughly half of the content is in Hindi, followed by English, Telugu and other regional languages. Roughly 41% of the data is text, 35% images, and 17% video. In this paper, we only focus on images, since images were a dominant modality of information sharing on WhatsApp. In total, our dataset consists of 1.6 million images. An important point to note about our data is the biases in sampling the groups. Since WhatsApp does not provide a way to search available groups, it is difficult to estimate the bias in our sample. A large fraction of the groups in our data (24.4%) apparently belong to the BJP (the party currently in power) and other unofficial religious groups loosely supporting the BJP. We could not find many groups from the main opposition party, Indian National Congress, which only accounts for 5% of the groups in our data. This bias could just reflect the lack of a coordinated WhatsApp strategy for the Congress . Also note that given this bias in sampling, the results from our analysis (e.g. prevalence of misinformation images) are only applicable to this dataset and may not generalize to the broader WhatsApp population. Annotating the images for misinformation We manually annotated a sample of 2,500 images with the help of three professional journalists. The journalists are experts in fact checking and regularly report on digital platforms. The 2,500 images were chosen to contain both a random sample of 500 images, and a set of 2,000 popular (most shared) images from our data. This effectively oversamples popular images while also enabling estimating prevalence in the full set of images. We built an annotation portal specifically for the journalists to view and annotate the images. Figure 2 shows the annotation portal. The portal shows an image and the annotators select from a set of four available options. Tools to check the image in the chat context in which it was shared, and to reverse image search were provided. The annotators had the following instructions: For each image, first check if it has already been fact checked by clicking on the `Image Reverse Search’ option to check where it has appeared on the web (using Google reverse image search). If you find the image already fact checked to be false in popular fact checking sites, please report where it was fact checked. If the image has not appeared on the web and is hard to fact check quickly, please mark the 4th option, needs concrete fact checking. If not, do you know if the image contains obvious misinformation (or not)? If it is not clear, first click on the `View Context’ button, to show the image in the chat context along with the text with which it was shared (Figure 2a). Figure 2 . (A) ANNOTATION PORTAL USED FOR ANNOTATING MISINFORMATION IMAGES, (B) IMAGE SHOWN IN THE CHAT CONTEXT IN WHICH IT WAS SHARED. We asked the annotators to select from four options: 1. Obviously not misinformation 2. Obvious misinformation 3. Already fact checked to be false 4. Needs concrete fact checking. The annotators could select only one option. In case an image is both misinformation and is fact checked, they selected the latter. The design of the options was due to the following considerations: a. We wanted to get a sense of the fraction of images that were already fact checked, b. Fact checking is an extremely time consuming operation for certain cases, and since we employed professional journalists, we could not ask them to spend a lot of time on each image, given that they had to annotate 2,500 images. So we gave them option 4 above, which they were asked to select only if they were highly uncertain. For getting a dataset of misinformation images, we combine the obvious misinformation and fact checked to false categories. The inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss’ Kappa) for the three annotators and three classes (misinformation/not misinformation and needs concrete fact checking) is 0.42 indicating a moderate level of agreement. In most cases, the disagreement comes from labeling (not) misinformation as needs concrete fact checking. The Fleiss Kappa for just the two classes (misinformation/not) is 0.78. In order to make sure that our final labeled dataset is of high quality, we did not consider the small set of cases with obvious disagreement (one journalist labeling it as misinformation while the other not). This gave us 605 images which were annotated to be false. Fact checked images We also collected images which were fact checked on popular fact checking websites from India . By scraping all the images present on these websites, we obtained close to 20,000 images. By matching the images from fact checking websites to the millions of images from our WhatsApp dataset using image matching techniques, we can find examples of fact checked images in our data. To do this, we used state of the art image matching techniques developed and being used at Facebook . The matching works by computing a 256-bit hash for each image. The hashing is done using a technique called perceptual hashing, which can detect near similar images, even if cropped differently or having small amounts of text overlaid. This gave us roughly 200 images which were fact checked to be false. We combined this with the above set manually labeled by us to obtain our final set of misinformation images. Image clustering Though images are hard to manipulate, we observe many instances of similar images with slight changes (e.g. see Figure 3) in our dataset. To combine variants of a similar image, we used the same image hashing algorithm (Facebook PDQ) to obtain hashes, and cluster the hashes together using the DBSCAN clustering algorithm (Esteret et al. 1996). This step ensures that we group together images which have similar content, and hence consider all variants of the image as a single cluster. A similar technique was used by (Zannettou et al. 2018) to measure the spread of memes in the US. Next, for a given annotated misinformation image, we include all the variants of images which were clustered together with the image as potential misinformation. This gave us around 40 thousand image instances corresponding to the 800 clusters, shared by over 13 thousand users. Figure 3 . FOUR EXAMPLES OF THE SAME IMAGE WITH DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS, CLUSTERED TOGETHER USING FACEBOOK PDQ HASHING: (A)IMAGE WITH A BORDER ADDED, (B) IMAGE WITH A RED WATERMARK, (C) IMAGE WITH A DIFFERENT BACKGROUND, AND, (D) IMAGE WITH A DIFFERENT COLOR FILTER APPLIED AND A RED LOGO ADDED. Prevalence estimation Note that we only annotated 2,500 images (2000 popular, and 500 random) from our entire dataset of millions of images. In order to estimate the prevalence of these types of images in the broader set of images in the monitored groups, we combine these samples for estimation and inference. In particular, the combined sample has positive (but heterogeneous) probability of including any image, so we can use standard inverse probability weighting (IPW) estimators and associated standard errors that are widely used in survey sampling to estimate these proportions (Särndal et al. 2003, Lumley 2004). More interestingly, we can also estimate prevalence among image shares, which reflects the chance that a random image share is of each type. For these estimates, we additionally post-stratify on percentiles of number of image shares to increase precision. Machine learning models To detect whether an image contains misinformation or not, we built machine learning models based on various features extracted from our data. The features can be grouped into two types: (i) Metadata features, which look at only information about the spread of the image in our data, and (ii) content features, which look at the content of the images. The class distribution is balanced using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (Chawla et al. 2002). So a random prediction would have an accuracy of 0.5. Metadata features: We used various types of metadata features of the images such as: (I) Spread features: (i) Groups in which the images were shared, (ii) users who shared the images, and (iii) how many times the image was shared. (II) Time features: (i) total time span of the image (difference in days between the first and last share), and (ii) average time between shares (a measure of virality). (III) Web features: (i) We used reverse Google image search to get a list of domains on which the image appears and used the list of domains as a feature, (ii) We also used the “web entities” end point from the Cloud Vision API , which returns entities found on the web related to the image. Now we check if there are any differences in the content of the images between the three classes. We primarily used Google’s Cloud Vision API to process and extract image content features. Cloud Vision API provides tools to identify objects and text in the image effectively, and works quite well even for non-English text. We obtained the features related to objects, text and faces from the image. Specifically, we extracted the following features: (I) Safe Search features: detects whether the image contains violence, racy, adult, etc. (II) Objects features: detects what objects are contained in the image. (III) Text features: Identifies text in the image (OCR) and if text exists, we create a tf-idf vector of the bag of words from this text. (IV) Face features: For images with faces, we extract facial features, like whether the person is angry, surprised, smiling, etc. (V) Color features: Identify the dominant colors in the image. In addition to the content features from Cloud Vision, we also obtained the fraction of pixels in an image that have been manipulated (Wu et al. 2019) and used a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) trained with Facebook’s ResNext architecture. We used a publicly available model provided by PyTorch pre-trained on ImageNet. The model is trained to predict one of the 1,000 ImageNet classes, given an image. For each image, we just consider the last layer of the model, a 1000-dimensional vector, indicating the probability of the image belonging to one of the 1,000 ImageNet classes as the features. We also included the text that was posted along with the image. To do this, we first obtained Doc2vec embeddings for text before and after the image. This gave us a 200 dimensional feature vector for text before and after each image. We tested multiple classifiers using the above features and chose a Random Forest classifier since it provides the best accuracy. All results reported are the mean of a 10 fold cross validation. We also tested the classifiers on the three types of image misinformation: images taken out of context, memes and manipulated images. Our expectation was that these features, specifically engineered for a specific type of misinformation would help in detecting that subset of misinformation images. We hypothesize that the following category specific features would work well. (i) Out-of-context images: Web domains. Web domains indicate the domains which are returned on a Google reverse image search for the image. Out-of-context images are typically shared by low quality domains or by domains which might have fact checked the image. Typically such low quality or fact checking domains are not returned for other categories of images, (ii) Manipulated images: We used a state of the art computer vision technique, which detects pixels which might have been manipulated (Wu et al. 2019). From this, we computed the fraction of pixels in an image which could have been manipulated. The intuition was that this fraction would be higher for manipulated images. However, the technique fails in our case since a lot of images which do not fall into this category are also falsely labeled as manipulated (see Figure 4 for an example), and, (iii) Memes: text on the image. Memes contain a lot of text on them. This category mostly contains memes with false quotes and statistics. The idea was that using text related features (e.g. tf-idf vectors), we could identify such false text.",0.0561273194723899,0.4571537995129547,neutral,"{'neg': 0.086, 'neu': 0.823, 'pos': 0.091, 'compound': 0.981}",positive

In a matter of days, Nepal has gone from a fragile democracy to a digital battleground where the future of the nation is being shaped not in parliament, but on Discord servers. The government’s blanket ban on 26 major social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, YouTube, and Discord, set off a chain of events that have now left the country without a government. At least 51 people are dead, hundreds are injured, and government buildings in Kathmandu lie in ruins after protests led by Gen Z escalated into mass unrest.

What began as a fight for digital freedom quickly snowballed into a political reckoning. Amid the chaos, a new center of power emerged from an unlikely place: Discord.

A ban that sparked a revolution

In Nepal, social media is more than a distraction; people’s lives depend on it. About 80% of all internet traffic in Nepal goes through social platforms. As of 2025, the country had 14.3 million active Facebook users, 3.9 million on Instagram, 2 million on LinkedIn, and nearly 400,000 on X (formerly Twitter). For millions of Nepalis, both at home and abroad, these platforms are lifelines for communication, commerce, and news.

On September 4, 2025, Nepal’s Supreme Court upheld the government’s decision to ban social media platforms under the Social Media Bill, 2025, and the earlier Social Media Directive of 2023. These laws required all local and international tech platforms to register with Nepali authorities, open local offices, appoint grievance officers, and moderate so-called “harmful” content. Non-compliance came with steep penalties, up to $71,000 for companies and $3,600 for individuals, in a country where the average annual income is just $1,456.

The law’s vague language, referring loosely to hate speech, trolling, and misleading information, has raised red flags among rights groups, who argue it gives the government unchecked power to silence critics. Even the definition of ""social media"" appeared confused: the banned list lumped together messaging services like WhatsApp and Signal with platforms like Reddit, Pinterest, and several obscure apps, suggesting a lack of technical understanding, or a deliberate overreach.

The government defended the move as a push for accountability, arguing that all tech platforms operating in Nepal should fall under national laws and taxation. The laws also granted the state sweeping authority to deny licenses to platforms it deemed harmful to ""peace, national unity, or sovereignty.""

The ban came amid frustration among Nepal’s youth, driven by soaring unemployment and a lack of economic opportunity. They were frustrated over the growing visibility of inequality, especially the sight of politicians’ children flaunting luxury handbags, expensive vacations, and elite lifestyles on social media while most Nepalis struggled to get by.

The social media ban, which severed millions from their daily channels of communication and business, including tourism, pushed the youth over the edge. Ironically, even government agencies themselves depended on Facebook and X for official communication, a contradiction not lost on critics. The government, meanwhile, urged citizens not to use VPNs, citing security risks, and called on them to comply with the ban. However, within hours, Nepal’s Gen Z, those born between 1997 and 2012, had bypassed the restrictions by using VPNs and alternative apps, such as TikTok. They organized a nationwide protest for September 8, which the state attempted to suppress with force, killing 19 people on the first day alone. The protest, initially planned as peaceful, spiraled into deadly violence and ultimately toppled the government in less than 30 hours.

A Discord democracy

Now, with official institutions in disarray, Nepal’s Gen Z has turned to online platforms, ironically, the very ones the government sought to suppress, to steer the country forward.

Just until a week ago, Discord was among the apps blocked by the government. Today, its anonymous servers are hosting thousands of Nepalis, both in-country and from the diaspora, discussing leadership, policy agendas, and the formation of an interim government. The main server, moderated by original protest organizers, reached its 10,000-user capacity, with discussions mirrored live across YouTube channels for broader access.

Groups like Hami Nepal, at the forefront of the protests, have led the transition from the streets to the screen. They've used banned platforms like Instagram and Facebook to publish unofficial press releases, issue public warnings about disinformation, and crowdsource leadership nominations from across the country. People are voting on potential interim leaders through polls, while others debate the country's political future on Discord channels. The spaces that were considered a threat to the country until a week ago have now become the country’s space for parliamentary discussions.

The aftermath of the protests continues to unfold online. Social media feeds are filled with footage of burning buildings, fleeing politicians, and intense street confrontations. But as the Gen Z-led movement gains momentum, it has also become increasingly difficult to distinguish between the “official” organizers, supporters, and impersonators. This confusion has made the movement vulnerable to misinformation.

One viral video falsely claimed that protest leaders had met with former King Gyanendra, who was ousted in 2008. The video circulated widely before being debunked by fact-checkers, who confirmed it was five months old. Even so, the narrative gained traction until protest leaders themselves publicly denied the rumors and reaffirmed their republican stance.

On the night of September 11, a protest leader was seen calling a military official, warning against any royal interference. This previously unheard-of level of transparency, where even army communications are made public, marks a dramatic shift in how political information is disseminated in Nepal. Traditional media has struggled to keep up with the rapid pace of unfiltered, real-time updates flooding in from social media.

Even serious claims have been weaponized. A widely shared false report alleged that the wife of a former Prime Minister had been burned alive. In reality, the former PM was alive but critically injured in the hospital.

Push for control and its global echo

Nepal’s digital crackdown mirrors a broader trend in Asia, where governments are increasingly invoking national security to restrict online speech.

The Social Media Bill, 2025, is widely seen as Nepal’s attempt to follow the digital authoritarian playbooks of China and India. The country had already banned TikTok in 2023 for allegedly disrupting ""social harmony"" before reinstating it in 2024 after Bytedance agreed to local compliance. In July 2025, Telegram was banned over concerns of online fraud and money laundering.

The government has also moved to centralize internet control through a proposed national internet gateway, echoing China’s Great Firewall. Reports of spyware procurement and new surveillance technologies have raised alarms, along with continued reliance on the outdated Electronic Transaction Act (2008), especially Section 47, which criminalizes vaguely defined “indecent” or “hate” content and is regularly used against dissenting voices.

Nepal’s recent steps are part of a regional authoritarian drift, and observers warn it could embolden similar moves across South Asia. Given the role of social media in the political upheaval in Bangladesh last year, the Gen Z uprising is not just a reaction to censorship, but a response to the broader fear of state overreach and the shrinking of civic space.

What has happened in Nepal is a warning to other democracies to tread carefully with efforts to contain online expression. The Nepalese government attempted to control the information ecosystem and lost control of the state itself. The challenge now is whether this energy can be channeled into a sustainable political alternative, or if it will burn out as quickly as it ignited.

As of 2025, the country had 14.3 million active Facebook users, 3.9 million on Instagram, 2 million on LinkedIn, and nearly 400,000 on X (formerly Twitter). For millions of Nepalis, both at home and abroad, these platforms are lifelines for communication, commerce, and news. On September 4, 2025, Nepal’s Supreme Court upheld the government’s decision to ban social media platforms under the Social Media Bill, 2025, and the earlier Social Media Directive of 2023. These laws required all local and international tech platforms to register with Nepali authorities, open local offices, appoint grievance officers, and moderate so-called “harmful” content. Non-compliance came with steep penalties, up to $71,000 for companies and $3,600 for individuals, in a country where the average annual income is just $1,456. The law’s vague language, referring loosely to hate speech, trolling, and misleading information, has raised red flags among rights groups, who argue it gives the government unchecked power to silence critics. Even the definition of ""social media"" appeared confused: the banned list lumped together messaging services like WhatsApp and Signal with platforms like Reddit, Pinterest, and several obscure apps, suggesting a lack of technical understanding, or a deliberate overreach. The government defended the move as a push for accountability, arguing that all tech platforms operating in Nepal should fall under national laws and taxation. The laws also granted the state sweeping authority to deny licenses to platforms it deemed harmful to ""peace, national unity, or sovereignty."" The ban came amid frustration among Nepal’s youth, driven by soaring unemployment and a lack of economic opportunity. They were frustrated over the growing visibility of inequality, especially the sight of politicians’ children flaunting luxury handbags, expensive vacations, and elite lifestyles on social media while most Nepalis struggled to get by. The social media ban, which severed millions from their daily channels of communication and business, including tourism, pushed the youth over the edge. Ironically, even government agencies themselves depended on Facebook and X for official communication, a contradiction not lost on critics. The government, meanwhile, urged citizens not to use VPNs, citing security risks, and called on them to comply with the ban. However, within hours, Nepal’s Gen Z, those born between 1997 and 2012, had bypassed the restrictions by using VPNs and alternative apps, such as TikTok. They organized a nationwide protest for September 8, which the state attempted to suppress with force, killing 19 people on the first day alone. The protest, initially planned as peaceful, spiraled into deadly violence and ultimately toppled the government in less than 30 hours. A Discord democracy Now, with official institutions in disarray, Nepal’s Gen Z has turned to online platforms, ironically, the very ones the government sought to suppress, to steer the country forward. Just until a week ago, Discord was among the apps blocked by the government. Today, its anonymous servers are hosting thousands of Nepalis, both in-country and from the diaspora, discussing leadership, policy agendas, and the formation of an interim government. The main server, moderated by original protest organizers, reached its 10,000-user capacity, with discussions mirrored live across YouTube channels for broader access. Groups like Hami Nepal, at the forefront of the protests, have led the transition from the streets to the screen. They've used banned platforms like Instagram and Facebook to publish unofficial press releases, issue public warnings about disinformation, and crowdsource leadership nominations from across the country. People are voting on potential interim leaders through polls, while others debate the country's political future on Discord channels. The spaces that were considered a threat to the country until a week ago have now become the country’s space for parliamentary discussions. The aftermath of the protests continues to unfold online. Social media feeds are filled with footage of burning buildings, fleeing politicians, and intense street confrontations. But as the Gen Z-led movement gains momentum, it has also become increasingly difficult to distinguish between the “official” organizers, supporters, and impersonators. This confusion has made the movement vulnerable to misinformation. One viral video falsely claimed that protest leaders had met with former King Gyanendra, who was ousted in 2008. The video circulated widely before being debunked by fact-checkers, who confirmed it was five months old. Even so, the narrative gained traction until protest leaders themselves publicly denied the rumors and reaffirmed their republican stance. On the night of September 11, a protest leader was seen calling a military official, warning against any royal interference. This previously unheard-of level of transparency, where even army communications are made public, marks a dramatic shift in how political information is disseminated in Nepal. Traditional media has struggled to keep up with the rapid pace of unfiltered, real-time updates flooding in from social media. Even serious claims have been weaponized. A widely shared false report alleged that the wife of a former Prime Minister had been burned alive. In reality, the former PM was alive but critically injured in the hospital. Push for control and its global echo Nepal’s digital crackdown mirrors a broader trend in Asia, where governments are increasingly invoking national security to restrict online speech. The Social Media Bill, 2025, is widely seen as Nepal’s attempt to follow the digital authoritarian playbooks of China and India. The country had already banned TikTok in 2023 for allegedly disrupting ""social harmony"" before reinstating it in 2024 after Bytedance agreed to local compliance. In July 2025, Telegram was banned over concerns of online fraud and money laundering. The government has also moved to centralize internet control through a proposed national internet gateway, echoing China’s Great Firewall. Reports of spyware procurement and new surveillance technologies have raised alarms, along with continued reliance on the outdated Electronic Transaction Act (2008), especially Section 47, which criminalizes vaguely defined “indecent” or “hate” content and is regularly used against dissenting voices. Nepal’s recent steps are part of a regional authoritarian drift, and observers warn it could embolden similar moves across South Asia. Given the role of social media in the political upheaval in Bangladesh last year, the Gen Z uprising is not just a reaction to censorship, but a response to the broader fear of state overreach and the shrinking of civic space. What has happened in Nepal is a warning to other democracies to tread carefully with efforts to contain online expression. The Nepalese government attempted to control the information ecosystem and lost control of the state itself. The challenge now is whether this energy can be channeled into a sustainable political alternative, or if it will burn out as quickly as it ignited.",-0.0315198444623223,0.3363806547434866,neutral,"{'neg': 0.174, 'neu': 0.758, 'pos': 0.068, 'compound': -0.9994}",negative

There are plenty of familiar favorites from the likes of Lego and Godiva, but the 2025 holiday season also brings some new Advent calendars for men and women, from a Hallmark Channel-inspired wine countdown to limited-edition beauty Advent calendars that offer impressive value (I'm talking $800-plus worth of makeup and skincare for $150). Not sure how you want to bring the cheer? You can't go wrong with countdowns filled with cheery chocolates, coffee pods, festive candles or mini bottles of wine.

There are plenty of familiar favorites from the likes of Lego and Godiva, but the 2025 holiday season also brings some new Advent calendars for men and women, from a Hallmark Channel-inspired wine countdown to limited-edition beauty Advent calendars that offer impressive value (I'm talking $800-plus worth of makeup and skincare for $150). Not sure how you want to bring the cheer? You can't go wrong with countdowns filled with cheery chocolates, coffee pods, festive candles or mini bottles of wine. Or better yet, spring for a reusable calendar and stick whatever you want inside. Some of this year's most popular Advent calendars — ahem, Bonne Maman and Anthropologie — are already sold out, and I'm sure everything else on this list will soon follow suit. My two cents: Make your pick now and yule rest easy from now until December 1. Best Advent calendars for 2025 Amazon Lego 'Harry Potter' Advent Calendar Have yourself a Harry little Christmas with this magic-filled countdown. I solemnly swear that the 2025 version is even better than the last — it's full of collectibles and deeper cuts like Aragog and Thestral, along with the main characters sporting their finest Fair Isle sweaters. $40 at Amazon Amazon Moyel Christmas Socks 12-Day Advent Calendar Funky socks make the holiday festivities all the more fun. Give your fashionista a dozen new pairs for just over $25 — all of them bring the cheer, but some are a little more on the nose than others (ahem, like ones featuring Santa front and center). And if you really want to up the ante, opt for the 24-day countdown to deliver double the fun. $27 at Amazon Apotheke Apotheke 25-Piece Advent Set Apotheke’s 25-piece Advent set is a luxe countdown for anyone who lives for good scents. Behind each door is a mini candle or home fragrance treat in the brand’s signature, spa-like aromas — think Charcoal, Sea Salt Grapefruit and White Vetiver. $250 at Apotheke The Woobles The Woobles Toy to the World Advent Calendar More people are turning to so-called ""grandma hobbies"" to relieve stress, myself included. And if learning how to crochet is on your to-do list, then follow my lead and turn to The Woobles for a helping hand. Beginners can lean into the fun with this DIY toy workshop, which comes with four full-size kits and a bunch of festive accessories, crochet hooks and other cheery add-ons. $140 at The Woobles Kendra Scott Kendra Scott 12 Days of Joy Bestsellers I'm not going to pretend that spending close to $400 on an Advent calendar is no big shake, but trust me, this cult-favorite countdown is well worth the splurge. You'll get a dozen bejeweled beauties in gold or silver, totaling over $800 in value — from the bestselling Elisa pendant to the ultra-sparkly Mikki Pave Huggie Earrings. That means, you're basically getting the whole lot for half off! $398 at Kendra Scott Sephora Voluspa Candle Advent Calendar Get twelve days of holiday scents in festive glass votives — some are sweet and spicy, others bring the outside in. The candles have an estimated 25-hour burn time, so you probably won't burn through 'em all by Christmas (especially if you have one of these nifty candle warmer lamps!). The cleaner the candle, the cleaner the burn. So, this countdown also comes with a gold-plated wick trimmer to help you keep things nice and neat. $140 at Voluspa Pottery Barn Kids Pottery Barn Kids Classic Santa Felt Christmas Advent Calendar Pottery Barn always delivers on the reusable Advent calendar front with mantel-worthy trains, felt wall hangings and tabletop countdowns. This felt favorite is a Christmas classic: Stuff sweets, coins and tiny trinkets into the drawers, then put it away and pull it out again next year. Personalize it with your kid's name or family's last name (up to 15 characters) for an extra $16. $60 at Pottery Barn Kids Best beauty Advent calendars Amazon Burt's Bees 12 Days of Joy Advent Calendar The weather outside is frightful, but your lips shouldn't be. Kidding ... kind of. Pick up this Advent calendar (for under $30, I might add) and get a dozen full-size lip balms in seasonal flavors like sugar cookie and cranberry spritz to soothe dry, cracked lips all season long. $30 at Amazon Sephora Sephora Collection Advent Calendar Sephora Collection is one of the store's best-kept secrets, and this 24-day countdown will introduce you to the brand's biggest sellers. There aren't any brushes in this bunch, but there are plenty of sheet masks, makeup bestsellers and limited-edition accessories to go 'round. Consider it a steal for younger beauty lovers dipping their toes — er, brushes — into makeup or anyone who wants to spruce up their stash with some fresh finds. $55 at Sephora L'Occitane L'Occitane Advent Calendar You know (and love) the brand's almond-scented shower oil, but have you tried everything else they have to offer? You're just in luck because this Advent calendar is jam-packed with the brand's best skin-soothers, from nourishing hand, foot and face creams to luxe shower upgrades. A surprising standout: The Cocon de Sérénité pillow mist, which is bound to bring the calm in the weeks leading up to Christmas. $168 at L'Occitane Lush Lush 12 Days of Christmas Advent Calendar Leave it to Lush to bring the calm amid the (delightful) chaos of the season. Unwrap a dozen bath, body or shower products in the lead-up to Santa's arrival — some are tailored to the holiday (like the Christmas Eve bubble bar), others will be recognizable to longtime Lush shoppers. $134 at Lush Beekman 1802 Beekman 1802 The G.O.A.T. 2025 Advent Calendar I'm not going to pretend that spending $200 on an Advent calendar is no small thing, but here's the deal: This bad boy is actually worth it — well, actually it's worth over $460. That's right, you'll get 24 of the brand's cult-favorite face and body products, from nourishing goat milk soap bars to skin-saving serums. Everything's ""clinically tested, scientifically proven and made for sensitive skin"" (Beekman's words, not mine). $199 at Beekman 1802 Ulta Benefit Cosmetics Glam Cube 24-Day Makeup Advent Calendar Here's another beauty bestseller that's not to be missed. This year, Benefit has turned its holiday countdown into a festive game of sorts. Spin, flip and reveal 24 of the brand's holy-grail items — some are full-size (hint, hint, Benetint), while others are fun-size and perfect for future travels. $149 at Ulta Best food and chocolate Advent calendars Amazon Godiva Chocolate Advent Calendar Godiva takes the cake, er, chocolate in the Advent calendar department. It's pricier than Lindt, Toblerone and Kinder, but the quality and selection is top-notch. You'll get the whole trifecta in this countdown: milk, dark and white chocolate. Some are straight chocolate, while others are filled with salted caramel, almond crunch and sweet ganache. $43 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $41 at Macy's Amazon Walker's Shortbread Advent Calendar I know there won't be a shortage of festive cookies come December, but who says you can't sprinkle in some (ahem, 24) butter-based biscuits into the mix? Not me, that's for sure. Fuel up for your own baking adventures with these timeless favorites, ranging from simple shortbread rounds to salted caramel squares. $32 at Amazon Compartes Compartes 'Wicked: For Good' Advent Calendar Sure, it's what's on the inside that counts, but this Advent calendar's packaging lays the foundation for a delicious flavor story. There's something wicked behind every door — get a Good Witch truffle one day and a Wicked Witch truffle the next. Let all Oz be agreed: These flavors are anything but ordinary, everything from Emerald City Elixir (matcha tea latte) to the aptly-named Yellow Brick Road (caramel honeycomb). $80 at Compartes Fly by Jing Fly by Jing Advent Calendar Fly by Jing's Sichuan Chili Crisp is a staple in my pantry. Yours too? You're in luck, because this holiday season, you can indulge in a dozen of the brand's best bites, including sauces, noodles and never-before-seen releases.

This pick from Pukka has 24 (!) different tea varieties — yep, not a single duplicate in this whole set. Some speak to the season's quintessential flavors (ginger chocolate and sweet cinnamon), while others will help you wind down before Santa comes to town (turmeric chamomile). $12 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $20 at Walmart Keurig Keurig 24 Cups of Cheer Advent Calendar The holidays are brewing, and so is your Keurig machine.

Pour yourself a glass of red, white, rosé or sparkling wine before tuning in for the ultimate wind-down.

Trending Christmas gifts

Amazon Aveeno Skin Relief Repairing Hand Masks, 4-Pack Who it's for: The woman itching for some quality R&R Why I picked it: Because her skin care routine shouldn't start and stop at her face. Simply slip on the shea butter-infused gloves and rub in any visible product after the 10 minutes is up to reveal smoother, softer hands. ""This is a godsend for my hands. I wish they had one body-sized,"" one soft-skinned shopper wrote. A tip: Snag each mask for under $4 a pop in this four-pack and divvy them up between stockings! $17 at Amazon

Amazon Body Restore Shower Steamers, 6-Pack Who it's for: Someone who needs some self-care Why I picked it: Sometimes, the only time she has for a little self-care is in the shower, so help her make the most of it with these heavenly smelling shower steamers. Made with baking soda and essential oils, these scented melts turn the daily wash into a spa-like experience. Each scent targets something specific: Lavender and Chamomile bring relaxation, Citrus Grove is a mood-booster, Eucalyptus Mint is a refreshing wake-up and so on. The steamers come in a pack of six, and each one lasts for at least one shower. ""A small luxury that makes a thoughtful gift,"" said this caring Amazon shopper. ""This set is my go-to gift for new moms; it's a simple way to pamper them at home without needing a spa day. I've given these to friends and my sisters after they've had babies, and they've all loved having a little something just for them."" $14 at Amazon

Amazon Etsfmoa Unisex Beanie with Light Who it's for: Adults who plan to keep on keepin' on during the depths of winter Why I picked it: This beanie really lit up the charts last holiday season. It was a No. 1 Amazon bestseller all winter long and one of the most popular picks in last year's gift guides. I have a feeling it won't be going anywhere anytime soon, so I'd snag it for the hard-to-shop-for person in your life who, ya know, needs to light their way when they walk the dog, take out the trash or tackle some chores after work. They'll get eight hours of light on a single charge; then they can power it up with a basic USB charger before their next after-hours adventure. $8 at Amazon

Amazon Body Restore Heated Eye Masks, 5-Pack Who it's for: Someone who needs 30 minutes of R&R Why I picked it: Hot compresses soothe dry, tired eyes. How exactly? Well, they boost oil production, relieving sensitivity and that all-too-familiar sting. Get these scented eye masks at a record-low price and bring comfort in minutes — they slowly (but surely) heat up when exposed to air and stay warm for up to 30 minutes. My advice: Stash them in your bag for on-the-go relief, but keep a few in your nightstand for when you need a little help winding down after a long day. $13 at Amazon

Amazon Marycele Candle Warmer Lamp Who it's for: Homebodies looking to bring the cozy Why I picked it: Lighting candles isn't for the faint of heart — there's the soot, smoke and, well, ever-present fear of forgetting to blow the flame out. Enter candle warmer lamps, which slowly melt the wax from the top down and release an aroma without a single flame. Crank it up to the highest brightness level for the strongest scent or dim the light for a subtle waft, then set a timer from two to eight hours to better control the glow. $30 at Amazon

Amazon Bedsure Heated Blanket Throw Blanket Who it's for: The person in your life who's always cold Why I picked it: We are headed toward the coldest time of the year! One of the best remedies for cold and gloomy nights is snuggling up with a warm blanket. While any old throw blanket will keep you warm, heated blankets are a must-have for those truly bone-chilling days or when you're too lazy to put on another layer of clothing. This pick — now at its lowest price in months — features a supersoft fleece material that is great without the heating, but even cozier with it. $50 at Amazon

Amazon Crock-Pot Electric Lunch Box Who it's for: Teachers, truckers and more on-the-go eaters Why I picked it: Think of this No. 1 bestseller as a mini slow cooker (20 ounces, to be exact) that anyone can take with them to keep food warm all day long. Plug it in about 45 minutes before mealtime for a piping hot nosh. ""As a teacher, this has got to be the most genius item that I have ever been gifted/gifted to others,"" one teacher raved. ""This item warms up not just soup, but smaller meals, in 30 minutes or less. I had a coworker who even plugged it in for up to 3-4 hours, and she stated that it did not burn her food. I would recommend to anyone who does not have a lot of time for lunch."" $40 at Amazon

Crate & Barrel KitchenAid Artisan Porcelain 5-Quart Tilt-Head Stand Mixer with Walnut Bowl Who it's for: Bakers and cooks who say the kitchen is their happy place Why I picked it: I know, I know, this stand mixer costs a pretty penny, but it is hands-down one of the most useful Christmas gifts you can give. It's more than a statement piece; it's a culinary rite of passage that'll help even the most novice home chefs whip up homemade breads, pastas, sweet treats and just about anything else that needs a good mixin' for years to come. Last year, the brand dropped its first-ever stand mixer with a wooden bowl — and this porcelain number is all-new for the 2025 holiday season. $600 at Crate & Barrel

Best Christmas gifts for men

Amazon Shanker Golf Frustrated Golfer Socks Who it's for: Golfers with a good sense of humor Why I picked it: These silly socks are for the guy who's on par for greatness, but his golf skills aren't PGA-worthy just yet. Alright, I'm not saying they paint an all-too-familiar picture of your golfer on the green, but I'm also not saying that they don't. Stuff 'em in his stocking for an easy laugh or include them in a bundle with a bunch of actually useful golf gifts for something a bit more well-rounded. $13 at Amazon

Amazon LifeStraw Personal Water Filter Who it's for: The ones who are always on the go Why I picked it: Even the most daring types need to keep their health and safety top of mind when they're on the trails. Whether for hiking, camping or everyday adventures, this portable filter can be used to procure instant hydration from any body of water — minus the microplastics, dirt, bacteria and parasites, that is. It's lightweight, doesn't take up much space and will definitely be put to good use. ""I love to give them as gifts,"" one shopper declared. ""Not only am I secretly giving my loved ones a survival tool, but they all think it’s totally cool when they get it!"" $16 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $20 at Ace Hardware

Amazon MoCuishle Shiatsu Back Shoulder and Neck Massager Who it's for: Do-it-all dads in need of some self-care Why I picked it: While, yes, you could always attempt (key word: attempt) to give him a shoulder rub, this electric massager will be more effective in working out his knots and kinks. Drape it over the shoulders or position it somewhere along the waist, then switch between three different speeds. ""This deep-tissue massage hurts and heals in equal measure,"" one relaxed reviewer wrote. $46 at Amazon

Wonderbly Wonderbly Your Life In Headlines Book Who it's for: Hard-to-shop-for history buffs Why I picked it: You can customize just about any gift, but only a few personalized presents are actually worthwhile. This is one of those nice-to-haves that he'll happily flip through and leave out on his coffee for all to see (which, let's face it, is a major win). All you have to do is submit his name and birthday (down to the year), then they'll fill the pages with all the major newspaper headlines from over the decades. He's sure to recognize a few (like if he happened to be born on the day of the moon landing), but others will be a welcome surprise. $90 at Wonderbly

Best Christmas gifts for women

Kate Spade Outlet Kate Spade Lucy Medium L-Zip Wristlet Who it's for: Your stylish sister Why I picked it: Your search for the ultimate holiday gift ends here. This gorgeous clutch is a chic phone, credit card and small essential carryall for those days when toting a purse is impractical.

The 79% discount saves you over $100 off the comparable value. $29 at Kate Spade Outlet

It has compartments galore, including a zipper pocket for easy access and side pouches with elastics to secure makeup brushes. And while it's on the larger side, it's sized to fit comfortably in a 24-inch suitcase (or, ya know, you can always carry it on its own).

Amazon Kendra Scott Mini Elisa Pendant Necklace Who it's for: The woman who wants to open a little yellow box on Christmas morning Why I picked it: Trust me, a little sparkle goes a long way — and this piece is proof. It's been a decade since its debut, but this Kendra Scott stunner gets hotter by the year, with Google searches increasing by 175% in 2024. There's a good chance she has one already (hey, the brand says it sells one necklace every minute!), but even if that's the case, you can choose from one of the other color combos — from this understated rose quartz beauty to more daring statements. $41 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $45 at Macy's$55 at Nordstrom

Amazon Carote Enameled Cast Iron Dutch Oven, 5 Quart Who it's for: The cook who prioritizes function and fashion Why I picked it: A Le Creuset Christmas may not be in the cards this year, but this stunner is made of sturdy cast iron just like its, er, more expensive counterparts.

One swift shopper (and fellow mama) pointed out that she uses it beyond her travels. ""I use my Luka duffel as a bag for my breast pump supplies when I go to work. It should seriously be marketed for this! All of the pockets are so great for storing different parts and snacks, and the shoe pocket is great for the pump itself. The material is awesome because it's so easy to clean."" (Psst, this Calpak classic was recently named one of Yahoo's Most Valuable Products.) $110 at Calpak

Amazon Skillmatics 'Lilo & Stitch' Poke-in Art Who it's for: School-age kids obsessed with Stitch Why I picked it: More than 20 years after the release of Disney's Lilo & Stitch, the fuzzy blue alien is still capturing hearts. This little guy has become even more popular in the last year due to the movie's live-action remake, and there are tons of new toys and games to show for it. This craft kit is one of the coolest releases I've seen — kids ages 4 and up can poke fabric squares through the holes of foam characters, then put the colorful creations on display.

Best Christmas gifts for tweens and teens

Amazon Flip 7 Card Game Who it's for: Gamers who are looking for something new Why I picked it: Card games are cooler than ever right now. UNO and Monopoly Deal are the heavy-hitters, but let me introduce you to the newest kid on the block: Flip 7, a fast-paced game where you try to reach 200 points without getting any duplicate cards. It's all about the luck of the draw — sure, there's strategy involved, but it's really a test of how badly you want to press your luck. More than 10,000 Amazon shoppers picked up a deck in the last month alone, and I bet that number will go up by the time the holidays roll 'round. $8 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $8 at Target$10 at CVS Pharmacy

Amazon Shashibo Shape Shifting Box Who it's for: Puzzlers who don't like being put in a box Why I picked it: I'm not a fan of one-and-done toys. Ya know, the ones that they play with for minutes and then spend years collecting dust in a closet somewhere. This geometric wonder can transform into a star, triangle or one of 70-plus other shapes, so it'll take 'em quite some time to see all that it has to offer. ""The fact that it is also magnetized is really neat as it allows some of the odd combinations to actually stick together and form free-standing structures,"" one proud puzzler penned. $18 at Amazon

Revolve Starface Big Lil' Gift Set Who it's for: The ones who accessorize with pimple patches Why I picked it: Giving acne products as gifts is usually a hard no for me, but pimple patches are now seen as a badge of honor for the younger generations. Inside this fuzzy, limited-edition case, they'll find a lip balm and 32 star-shaped patches that are just as cute as they are effective. The clear ones are best for surface-level pimples, but the blue stars tackle deeper clogged pores and, ya know, make a splashier statement. $20 at Revolve

(Photo Illustration: Amanda Garrity/Yahoo News; Amazon) Dare I ask, how's your Christmas shopping coming along? I'm not here to get your tinsel in a tangle, but you know as well as I do that holiday shipping deadlines are getting closer by the day. Feeling more frazzled than festive right about now? This list of the best Christmas gifts is my present to you. I've got all the bases covered down below, from hard-to-please tweens and teens to the parents who have it all. Eyeing something special for your mom or dad? Forget the Jelly of the Month Club nonsense and opt for a top-selling back massager or towel warmer instead. What about a Christmas gift for your, um, very particular sister? Tap into the trends and get her something from Starface or Kendra Scott. Grouped by recipient for easier shopping, this curated Christmas gift guide will help you find the perfect present for everyone on your list — from gift ideas for men and presents for women of all ages to the kids that they're raising and all the loved ones in between. As of right now, all of these picks will hit your doorstep (or theirs!) just in time for the festivities, but there's no guarantee shipping estimates will stay on your side. My advice: Shop now and rest easy until the big day. Trending Christmas gifts Amazon Aveeno Skin Relief Repairing Hand Masks, 4-Pack Who it's for: The woman itching for some quality R&R Why I picked it: Because her skin care routine shouldn't start and stop at her face. Simply slip on the shea butter-infused gloves and rub in any visible product after the 10 minutes is up to reveal smoother, softer hands. ""This is a godsend for my hands. I wish they had one body-sized,"" one soft-skinned shopper wrote. A tip: Snag each mask for under $4 a pop in this four-pack and divvy them up between stockings! $17 at Amazon Amazon Body Restore Shower Steamers, 6-Pack Who it's for: Someone who needs some self-care Why I picked it: Sometimes, the only time she has for a little self-care is in the shower, so help her make the most of it with these heavenly smelling shower steamers. Made with baking soda and essential oils, these scented melts turn the daily wash into a spa-like experience. Each scent targets something specific: Lavender and Chamomile bring relaxation, Citrus Grove is a mood-booster, Eucalyptus Mint is a refreshing wake-up and so on. The steamers come in a pack of six, and each one lasts for at least one shower. ""A small luxury that makes a thoughtful gift,"" said this caring Amazon shopper. ""This set is my go-to gift for new moms; it's a simple way to pamper them at home without needing a spa day. I've given these to friends and my sisters after they've had babies, and they've all loved having a little something just for them."" $14 at Amazon Amazon Etsfmoa Unisex Beanie with Light Who it's for: Adults who plan to keep on keepin' on during the depths of winter Why I picked it: This beanie really lit up the charts last holiday season. It was a No. 1 Amazon bestseller all winter long and one of the most popular picks in last year's gift guides. I have a feeling it won't be going anywhere anytime soon, so I'd snag it for the hard-to-shop-for person in your life who, ya know, needs to light their way when they walk the dog, take out the trash or tackle some chores after work. They'll get eight hours of light on a single charge; then they can power it up with a basic USB charger before their next after-hours adventure. $8 at Amazon Amazon Body Restore Heated Eye Masks, 5-Pack Who it's for: Someone who needs 30 minutes of R&R Why I picked it: Hot compresses soothe dry, tired eyes. How exactly? Well, they boost oil production, relieving sensitivity and that all-too-familiar sting. Get these scented eye masks at a record-low price and bring comfort in minutes — they slowly (but surely) heat up when exposed to air and stay warm for up to 30 minutes. My advice: Stash them in your bag for on-the-go relief, but keep a few in your nightstand for when you need a little help winding down after a long day. $13 at Amazon Amazon Marycele Candle Warmer Lamp Who it's for: Homebodies looking to bring the cozy Why I picked it: Lighting candles isn't for the faint of heart — there's the soot, smoke and, well, ever-present fear of forgetting to blow the flame out. Enter candle warmer lamps, which slowly melt the wax from the top down and release an aroma without a single flame. Crank it up to the highest brightness level for the strongest scent or dim the light for a subtle waft, then set a timer from two to eight hours to better control the glow. $30 at Amazon Amazon Bedsure Heated Blanket Throw Blanket Who it's for: The person in your life who's always cold Why I picked it: We are headed toward the coldest time of the year! One of the best remedies for cold and gloomy nights is snuggling up with a warm blanket. While any old throw blanket will keep you warm, heated blankets are a must-have for those truly bone-chilling days or when you're too lazy to put on another layer of clothing. This pick — now at its lowest price in months — features a supersoft fleece material that is great without the heating, but even cozier with it. $50 at Amazon Amazon Crock-Pot Electric Lunch Box Who it's for: Teachers, truckers and more on-the-go eaters Why I picked it: Think of this No. 1 bestseller as a mini slow cooker (20 ounces, to be exact) that anyone can take with them to keep food warm all day long. Plug it in about 45 minutes before mealtime for a piping hot nosh. ""As a teacher, this has got to be the most genius item that I have ever been gifted/gifted to others,"" one teacher raved. ""This item warms up not just soup, but smaller meals, in 30 minutes or less. I had a coworker who even plugged it in for up to 3-4 hours, and she stated that it did not burn her food. I would recommend to anyone who does not have a lot of time for lunch."" $40 at Amazon Crate & Barrel KitchenAid Artisan Porcelain 5-Quart Tilt-Head Stand Mixer with Walnut Bowl Who it's for: Bakers and cooks who say the kitchen is their happy place Why I picked it: I know, I know, this stand mixer costs a pretty penny, but it is hands-down one of the most useful Christmas gifts you can give. It's more than a statement piece; it's a culinary rite of passage that'll help even the most novice home chefs whip up homemade breads, pastas, sweet treats and just about anything else that needs a good mixin' for years to come. Last year, the brand dropped its first-ever stand mixer with a wooden bowl — and this porcelain number is all-new for the 2025 holiday season. $600 at Crate & Barrel Best Christmas gifts for men Amazon Rak Magnetic Wristband Who it's for: Do-it-yourselfers who are big on efficiency Why I picked it: Here's an affordable way for your handy helper to get a whole lot, well, handier. The next time they're doing a project around the house, they can slip on this wristband to keep nails, screws and drill bits within arm's reach. Thousands of Amazon shoppers say it's a must in any toolbox, including one reviewer who bought it for her husband and raved that it ""saves him trips back and forth and he doesn't have to worry about screws or nails falling to the ground."" $16 at Amazon Amazon Shanker Golf Frustrated Golfer Socks Who it's for: Golfers with a good sense of humor Why I picked it: These silly socks are for the guy who's on par for greatness, but his golf skills aren't PGA-worthy just yet. Alright, I'm not saying they paint an all-too-familiar picture of your golfer on the green, but I'm also not saying that they don't. Stuff 'em in his stocking for an easy laugh or include them in a bundle with a bunch of actually useful golf gifts for something a bit more well-rounded. $13 at Amazon Amazon LifeStraw Personal Water Filter Who it's for: The ones who are always on the go Why I picked it: Even the most daring types need to keep their health and safety top of mind when they're on the trails. Whether for hiking, camping or everyday adventures, this portable filter can be used to procure instant hydration from any body of water — minus the microplastics, dirt, bacteria and parasites, that is. It's lightweight, doesn't take up much space and will definitely be put to good use. ""I love to give them as gifts,"" one shopper declared. ""Not only am I secretly giving my loved ones a survival tool, but they all think it’s totally cool when they get it!"" $16 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $20 at Ace Hardware Amazon MoCuishle Shiatsu Back Shoulder and Neck Massager Who it's for: Do-it-all dads in need of some self-care Why I picked it: While, yes, you could always attempt (key word: attempt) to give him a shoulder rub, this electric massager will be more effective in working out his knots and kinks. Drape it over the shoulders or position it somewhere along the waist, then switch between three different speeds. ""This deep-tissue massage hurts and heals in equal measure,"" one relaxed reviewer wrote. $46 at Amazon Wonderbly Wonderbly Your Life In Headlines Book Who it's for: Hard-to-shop-for history buffs Why I picked it: You can customize just about any gift, but only a few personalized presents are actually worthwhile. This is one of those nice-to-haves that he'll happily flip through and leave out on his coffee for all to see (which, let's face it, is a major win). All you have to do is submit his name and birthday (down to the year), then they'll fill the pages with all the major newspaper headlines from over the decades. He's sure to recognize a few (like if he happened to be born on the day of the moon landing), but others will be a welcome surprise. $90 at Wonderbly Best Christmas gifts for women Kate Spade Outlet Kate Spade Lucy Medium L-Zip Wristlet Who it's for: Your stylish sister Why I picked it: Your search for the ultimate holiday gift ends here. This gorgeous clutch is a chic phone, credit card and small essential carryall for those days when toting a purse is impractical. And while I adore the plum-like ""Red Jam"" hue for fall and winter, it also comes in light pink and a slew of pretty colors. The 79% discount saves you over $100 off the comparable value. $29 at Kate Spade Outlet Amazon Bagsmart Travel Toiletry Bag Who it's for: Travelers who want to pack smarter, not harder Why I picked it: Frequent fliers love this lightweight, water-resistant toiletry bag. It has compartments galore, including a zipper pocket for easy access and side pouches with elastics to secure makeup brushes. And while it's on the larger side, it's sized to fit comfortably in a 24-inch suitcase (or, ya know, you can always carry it on its own). Even Oprah's a fan — this classic was also named one of Oprah's Favorite Things for 2025. $30 at Amazon Amazon Kendra Scott Mini Elisa Pendant Necklace Who it's for: The woman who wants to open a little yellow box on Christmas morning Why I picked it: Trust me, a little sparkle goes a long way — and this piece is proof. It's been a decade since its debut, but this Kendra Scott stunner gets hotter by the year, with Google searches increasing by 175% in 2024. There's a good chance she has one already (hey, the brand says it sells one necklace every minute!), but even if that's the case, you can choose from one of the other color combos — from this understated rose quartz beauty to more daring statements. $41 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $45 at Macy's$55 at Nordstrom Amazon Carote Enameled Cast Iron Dutch Oven, 5 Quart Who it's for: The cook who prioritizes function and fashion Why I picked it: A Le Creuset Christmas may not be in the cards this year, but this stunner is made of sturdy cast iron just like its, er, more expensive counterparts. From boiling and braising to roasting and baking, this kitchen workhorse does it all — and looks incredibly good while doing it. It can be used on just about any type of stovetop, and it's oven-safe up to 500°F. $36 at Amazon Calpak Calpak Luka Duffel Who it's for: Travelers who want to pack smarter, not harder Why I picked it: Frequent fliers (including my own mom!) love this lightweight, water-resistant weekender, which has all the bells and whistles, including a trolley sleeve, a separate shoe compartment and pockets galore. One swift shopper (and fellow mama) pointed out that she uses it beyond her travels. ""I use my Luka duffel as a bag for my breast pump supplies when I go to work. It should seriously be marketed for this! All of the pockets are so great for storing different parts and snacks, and the shoe pocket is great for the pump itself. The material is awesome because it's so easy to clean."" (Psst, this Calpak classic was recently named one of Yahoo's Most Valuable Products.) $110 at Calpak Amazon Sameat Heated Towel Warmer Who it's for: The woman who has it all (or so she thinks) Why I picked it: Towel warmers are the epitome of affordable luxury — a simple way to elevate the everyday. This top-rated pick turns any bathroom into a home spa by heating two oversized towels or robes at a time. She can even set a timer so it's ready to go as soon as she hops out of the shower. $110 at Amazon Best Christmas gifts for toddlers and kids Amazon Schylling NeeDoh Gumdrop Who it's for: Little ones who like keeping their hands busy Why I picked it: Kids can squish and stretch this glittery sensory toy to their heart's content, then watch it return back to its normal teardrop shape. ""It's satisfying to hold and squish without being *too* squishy. There is a slight firmness to it that makes it really satisfying to squeeze and even to roll between your hands,"" one happy customer wrote. Just keep in mind that you can't pick a color when you place your order, so it'll be a pleasant surprise for both of you. $9 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $8 at Walmart Amazon Scrib3d P1 3D Printing Pen Who it's for: Young creatives who want to bring their art to life Why I picked it: Kids can turn basic doodles into 3D creations. Crank up the speed to fill something in or dial it back when working on itty-bitty details. ""Once we figured out how to operate it (starting, switching filament, pausing, stopping and cleaning), we were on roll,"" one happy parent wrote. ""My son is into Super Mario so we are making all the characters from the game."" While you're at it, pick up a pack of filament refills at Amazon so your crafter doesn't run out anytime soon. $35 at Amazon Amazon PicassoTiles Building Tiles 100 Piece Set Who it's for: Little builders who turn every room into a construction site. Why I picked it: ""If I asked my toddler which toys are her favorite, Picasso Tiles come out on top and it's not even close,"" says Senior Deals Writer Chris McGraw. ""We've built castles, racetracks, airplanes and UFOs (they may also get played with when my kiddo is nowhere to be found), and right now they're down to $40, though can you really put a price tag on a toddler's joy?"" $31 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $40 at Best Buy Amazon Skillmatics 'Lilo & Stitch' Poke-in Art Who it's for: School-age kids obsessed with Stitch Why I picked it: More than 20 years after the release of Disney's Lilo & Stitch, the fuzzy blue alien is still capturing hearts. This little guy has become even more popular in the last year due to the movie's live-action remake, and there are tons of new toys and games to show for it. This craft kit is one of the coolest releases I've seen — kids ages 4 and up can poke fabric squares through the holes of foam characters, then put the colorful creations on display. Kids will work on their fine motor skills; parents will breathe a sigh of relief since it's basically mess-free. Not sure whether Stitch is totally their speed? There are tons of kits to choose from — princesses, flower bouquets, underwater animals and more. $35 at Amazon Amazon Squishmallows Jonessa The Purple Psychedelic Tie-Dye Bear Who it's for: Squishmallows fans who always want the latest and greatest Why I picked it: Alright, I know their Squishmallows collection is probably out of control by now, but how can you pass up an all-new release? This adorable tie-dye bear is dropping just in time for the holidays, so there's a good chance your kid won't even know about it. Pre-order it ASAP to guarantee on-time arrival, then rest easy knowing you're winning Christmas this year. $16 at Amazon Best Christmas gifts for tweens and teens Amazon Flip 7 Card Game Who it's for: Gamers who are looking for something new Why I picked it: Card games are cooler than ever right now. UNO and Monopoly Deal are the heavy-hitters, but let me introduce you to the newest kid on the block: Flip 7, a fast-paced game where you try to reach 200 points without getting any duplicate cards. It's all about the luck of the draw — sure, there's strategy involved, but it's really a test of how badly you want to press your luck. More than 10,000 Amazon shoppers picked up a deck in the last month alone, and I bet that number will go up by the time the holidays roll 'round. $8 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $8 at Target$10 at CVS Pharmacy Amazon Sol de Janeiro Bum Bum Jet Set Who it's for: Tweens, teens or anyone else who likes keeping up with the trends Why I picked it: Ask any teen and they'll tell you that Sol de Janeiro makes their favorite scents. Cheirosa 62 is the brand's biggest seller — it's sweet, nutty and as warm as the Brazilian sunshine that inspired it. Instead of wrapping up a single tub (it's a whopping $48), opt for this trio, which also includes travel-friendly versions of the perfume mist and body wash in the same scent. $34 at Amazon Amazon Muid Benson Lying Flat Duck Night Light Who it's for: The too-cool-for-school teen who is still just a kid Why I picked it: When in doubt, go with a gift that'll really quack them up. Give this light-up duck a pat on the back to adjust between three brightness levels or set a 30-minute timer. I get it: They're too big for a nightlight (or so they claim), but who can resist a bedside companion as cute as this little guy? $18 at Amazon Amazon Shashibo Shape Shifting Box Who it's for: Puzzlers who don't like being put in a box Why I picked it: I'm not a fan of one-and-done toys. Ya know, the ones that they play with for minutes and then spend years collecting dust in a closet somewhere. This geometric wonder can transform into a star, triangle or one of 70-plus other shapes, so it'll take 'em quite some time to see all that it has to offer. ""The fact that it is also magnetized is really neat as it allows some of the odd combinations to actually stick together and form free-standing structures,"" one proud puzzler penned. $18 at Amazon Revolve Starface Big Lil' Gift Set Who it's for: The ones who accessorize with pimple patches Why I picked it: Giving acne products as gifts is usually a hard no for me, but pimple patches are now seen as a badge of honor for the younger generations.

Best white elephant gifts overall

Amazon HappyBag LED Lying Flat Duck Light I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't give this little guy a mention. Last year, thousands of Yahoo readers picked up light-up duck and, well, I'm sure it got everyone at the party in the stealing spirit. Simply give the duck a gentle pat on the back to make it glow, then adjust the brightness level to one of three settings and set up the optional 30-minute timer. ""I love that it’s USB-charged, so no fumbling with batteries and a full charge lasts all night — enough for midnight journeys to the bathroom (or snack raids),"" one happy Amazon shopper quacked. $20 at Amazon

Amazon Godonlif Candle Warmer Lamp Lighting candles isn't for the faint of heart. There's the soot, smoke, overwhelming fear that you forget to blow it out and the ever-present risk of fire. Candle warmer lamps are a smarter bet: They slowly melt the wax from the top down and release an aroma without a single flame. The brighter the light, the stronger the fragrance — switch between four brightness levels and set a timer to turn it off automatically. ""I love that this lamp has an adjustable height to work with any size candle and that it helps my candles last longer than traditional burning,"" one fired-up Amazon shopper raved about this bestseller with almost 5,000 reviews and an average 4.6-star rating. $21 at Amazon

Amazon CraveBox Snack Box Because food is the way to the heart, isn't it? Replenish their snack stash with a mix of sweet and salty favorites — I'm talking Rice Krispies Treats, Chex Mix, Skittles and more. All bets are off on whether they'll share with the other party-goers, but for your sake, I hope they do! $31 at Amazon

Funniest white elephant gifts

Amazon Snactiv Pro Snack Chopsticks A little bit of flavor dust doesn't hurt, but it can certainly get in the way if you're trying to do literally anything else while you get your snack on. Enter my most random (but useful) Shark Tank discovery yet: finger chopsticks, which let you grip chips, cheese puffs or your munchies of choice without dirtying up your hands. Can you snack without it? Obviously. But should you settle for greasy controllers or a crumb-filled keyboard? Nope, and that's why it's a great white elephant gift in my eyes! $18 at Amazon

SeaRoomy SeaRoomy Burritos Tortilla Blanket If you’re aiming for the gift everyone will fight over, this burrito blanket is it. With over 6,000 five-star Amazon reviews, this ultra-soft throw wraps you up like a giant tortilla — equal parts cozy and hilarious. It’s big, warm, machine-washable and guaranteed to spark at least one “I’m a snack” photo op. $13 at Amazon

Amazon Charmin Forever Roll Starter Kit A gag gift that's still incredibly useful? Now, we're talkin'. This isn't your average TP; nope, this supersized roll has over 5,000 sheets and can last up to a month (not exactly forever like the name implies, but still). Spring for the starter set, so they'll get double the paper and a holder that's actually designed to handle rolls of this size. $35 at Amazon

Uncommon Goods Unlock the Wine Escape Room Game No one would willingly give up a good bottle of wine, but wouldn't you like to see how badly they want it? Stick your go-to red, white or rosé in the cage, then they'll have to solve escape room-style puzzles and riddles to crack the code. ""It is not easy to solve, but the challenge is worth it,"" one Uncommon Goods reviewer wrote. See? Where there's a wine, there's a way. $30 at Uncommon Goods

Most useful white elephant gifts

Amazon Ototo Splatypus Jar Spatula Because nobody should let precious peanut butter go to waste. This jar scraper is basically a silicone spatula disguised as a platypus (naturally), but it has a longer handle and sturdier (yet flexible) base designed to easily scrape the sides of any jar or container. Use it to clear out the nooks and crannies in all kinds of things — jarred sauces, jams, yogurt containers, the possibilities are infinite. $10 at Amazon

Amazon Glocusent Bendable Neck Light Yes, late-night reading types can wrap this hands-free gadget around their neck to light up the pages, but that's really just scratching the surface here. Thousands of Amazon shoppers (including yours truly!) reach for it when they're crafting, tinkering or even tending to some household chores after the sun goes down. Tailor it to the task at hand — choose between six brightness levels and three colors until the light's just right. More than 10,000 Amazon shoppers picked it up last month, with one writing that they originally bought it ""so I could crochet at night when my husband wanted the room dark for TV"" but found it especially useful to ""have on hand in case there's a storm when you lose electricity."" $16 at Amazon

Amazon Ontel Battery Daddy Storage System This may not seem like the most exciting white elephant gift out there, but here's where I beg to differ: This beloved bestseller is one of those things that most people don't have, but would actually benefit from. Sure, the lucky recipient may have a system (or say they say) to find the battery they're looking for, but this organizer will divide them up by size and type to make the search a whole lot easier. It even has a built-in tester to ensure that they're only keeping the ones that still have some life left in 'em. $17 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $17 at Target$17 at Ace Hardware

QVC Scrub Daddy Scrub Mommy Sponges Gift Box, Set of 2 There comes a time in everyone's life when they get excited about opening up a new pack of sponges. Give that experience to a special someone — times eight! Only you know your budget, so I'll let you decide if you wrap up both boxes or give them one set and save the other for someone else. $20 at QVC

Amazon Nodpod Gentle Pressure Sleep Mask A good night's sleep is hands-down the best gift you can give, and this weighted eye mask may be just the thing they need to snooze soundly. It blocks out light while applying gentle pressure across the head, hence why the brand describes it as a ""weighted blanket for your eyes."" Thousands of well-rested Amazon reviewers gush that it's changed their sleep game, including a night-shift nurse who called it a ""marvelous little invention"" and said it ""stays put even if you're a side sleeper."" $27 at Ulta

orastone Orastone Rechargeable Hand Warmer This rechargeable hand warmer has racked up more than 6,000 Amazon reviews and a 4.6-star rating — and shoppers rave about how quickly it heats up, how toasty it gets and, yes, how cute it is. It reaches over 100 degrees in under two minutes, fits comfortably in your palm and comes in fun patterns with a handy wrist strap. $24 at Amazon

Best white elephant gifts for kids and teens

Amazon Rubik’s Phantom Cube There's more than meets the eye here. The black tiles will change color with the heat of touch, presenting the puzzler with quite the challenge: solving the cube before the whole thing fades back to black. Part gag gift, part brain-bender, this cube is a true challenge for serious cubers — but a fun one at that! $9 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $9 at Target$20 at Ace Hardware

Amazon Flip 7 Card Game Card games are always a white elephant winner, but I'd steer clear of the classics since there's a good chance the recipient already has them. My suggestion: Go with the deck that's currently dominating the Amazon charts. Meet Flip 7, a fast-paced game where you try to reach 200 points without getting any duplicate cards. Sure, there's plenty of strategy involved, but it's really a test of how much you're willing to push your luck. $8 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $8 at Target$10 at CVS Pharmacy

Amazon Schylling NeeDoh Ramen Noodlies Let them squish, twist and toss these sensory strings, er, noodles to their heart's content. Throw them into a sensory bin to really get their juices flowing, or play with them as-is. Both are equally as fun.

Amazon The Woobles Learn to Crochet Kit Grandma's hobbies are cooler than ever. Case in point: Google searches for these beginner-friendly crochet kits shot up 95% this year. Pierre the Penguin is the brand's hottest seller — this kit comes with everything you need to stitch the waddliest Wooble in the bunch, including step-by-step video tutorials, an ergonomic crochet hook, pre-started yarn and stuffing There's a good chance they'll get hooked (get it?), so tell the recipient they can always give Pierre a few friends (ahem, Walter the Bear and Felix the Fox). $37 at Amazon",https://shopping.yahoo.com/gift-ideas/article/white-elephant-gift-ideas-194723818.html,2025-12-12 22:00:55+00:00,"These fun (and functional) gift ideas will bring the party. That's my goal, at least. (Photo Illustration: Amanda Garrity/Yahoo News; Getty) White elephant exchanges aren't just about the laughs. Nope, everyone needs to show up with a quality Christmas gift that's actually worth fighting for. As for the white elephant gift ideas below? They’re straight-up steal-worthy. From funny gags to more useful buys, these white elephant gifts cover all the bases (for under $50, I might add!). Trying to get the teens involved? Snacking chopsticks are the ticket. What about a practical pick for people that you don't know as well? Stick with tried-and-true favorites, from a bestselling battery organizer that's a recent Yahoo Best Gift Ever Awards winner to a dimmable duck lamp (the top-seller from last year's white elephant gift guide!). These are just some of the highlights — I've also included a bunch of gift ideas for kids, tweens and teens, since they deserve to get in on the fun too. Have more parties on the books this holiday season? Then head on over to our Secret Santa gift guide while you're in the shopping spirit. Best white elephant gifts overall Amazon HappyBag LED Lying Flat Duck Light I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't give this little guy a mention. Last year, thousands of Yahoo readers picked up light-up duck and, well, I'm sure it got everyone at the party in the stealing spirit. Simply give the duck a gentle pat on the back to make it glow, then adjust the brightness level to one of three settings and set up the optional 30-minute timer. ""I love that it’s USB-charged, so no fumbling with batteries and a full charge lasts all night — enough for midnight journeys to the bathroom (or snack raids),"" one happy Amazon shopper quacked. $20 at Amazon Amazon Godonlif Candle Warmer Lamp Lighting candles isn't for the faint of heart. There's the soot, smoke, overwhelming fear that you forget to blow it out and the ever-present risk of fire. Candle warmer lamps are a smarter bet: They slowly melt the wax from the top down and release an aroma without a single flame. The brighter the light, the stronger the fragrance — switch between four brightness levels and set a timer to turn it off automatically. ""I love that this lamp has an adjustable height to work with any size candle and that it helps my candles last longer than traditional burning,"" one fired-up Amazon shopper raved about this bestseller with almost 5,000 reviews and an average 4.6-star rating. $21 at Amazon Amazon CraveBox Snack Box Because food is the way to the heart, isn't it? Replenish their snack stash with a mix of sweet and salty favorites — I'm talking Rice Krispies Treats, Chex Mix, Skittles and more. All bets are off on whether they'll share with the other party-goers, but for your sake, I hope they do! $31 at Amazon Funniest white elephant gifts Amazon Snactiv Pro Snack Chopsticks A little bit of flavor dust doesn't hurt, but it can certainly get in the way if you're trying to do literally anything else while you get your snack on. Enter my most random (but useful) Shark Tank discovery yet: finger chopsticks, which let you grip chips, cheese puffs or your munchies of choice without dirtying up your hands. Can you snack without it? Obviously. But should you settle for greasy controllers or a crumb-filled keyboard? Nope, and that's why it's a great white elephant gift in my eyes! $18 at Amazon SeaRoomy SeaRoomy Burritos Tortilla Blanket If you’re aiming for the gift everyone will fight over, this burrito blanket is it. With over 6,000 five-star Amazon reviews, this ultra-soft throw wraps you up like a giant tortilla — equal parts cozy and hilarious. It’s big, warm, machine-washable and guaranteed to spark at least one “I’m a snack” photo op. $13 at Amazon Amazon Charmin Forever Roll Starter Kit A gag gift that's still incredibly useful? Now, we're talkin'. This isn't your average TP; nope, this supersized roll has over 5,000 sheets and can last up to a month (not exactly forever like the name implies, but still). Spring for the starter set, so they'll get double the paper and a holder that's actually designed to handle rolls of this size. $35 at Amazon Uncommon Goods Unlock the Wine Escape Room Game No one would willingly give up a good bottle of wine, but wouldn't you like to see how badly they want it? Stick your go-to red, white or rosé in the cage, then they'll have to solve escape room-style puzzles and riddles to crack the code. ""It is not easy to solve, but the challenge is worth it,"" one Uncommon Goods reviewer wrote. See? Where there's a wine, there's a way. $30 at Uncommon Goods Most useful white elephant gifts Amazon Ototo Splatypus Jar Spatula Because nobody should let precious peanut butter go to waste. This jar scraper is basically a silicone spatula disguised as a platypus (naturally), but it has a longer handle and sturdier (yet flexible) base designed to easily scrape the sides of any jar or container. Use it to clear out the nooks and crannies in all kinds of things — jarred sauces, jams, yogurt containers, the possibilities are infinite. $10 at Amazon Amazon Glocusent Bendable Neck Light Yes, late-night reading types can wrap this hands-free gadget around their neck to light up the pages, but that's really just scratching the surface here. Thousands of Amazon shoppers (including yours truly!) reach for it when they're crafting, tinkering or even tending to some household chores after the sun goes down. Tailor it to the task at hand — choose between six brightness levels and three colors until the light's just right. More than 10,000 Amazon shoppers picked it up last month, with one writing that they originally bought it ""so I could crochet at night when my husband wanted the room dark for TV"" but found it especially useful to ""have on hand in case there's a storm when you lose electricity."" $16 at Amazon Amazon Ontel Battery Daddy Storage System This may not seem like the most exciting white elephant gift out there, but here's where I beg to differ: This beloved bestseller is one of those things that most people don't have, but would actually benefit from. Sure, the lucky recipient may have a system (or say they say) to find the battery they're looking for, but this organizer will divide them up by size and type to make the search a whole lot easier. It even has a built-in tester to ensure that they're only keeping the ones that still have some life left in 'em. $17 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $17 at Target$17 at Ace Hardware QVC Scrub Daddy Scrub Mommy Sponges Gift Box, Set of 2 There comes a time in everyone's life when they get excited about opening up a new pack of sponges. Give that experience to a special someone — times eight! Only you know your budget, so I'll let you decide if you wrap up both boxes or give them one set and save the other for someone else. $20 at QVC Amazon Nodpod Gentle Pressure Sleep Mask A good night's sleep is hands-down the best gift you can give, and this weighted eye mask may be just the thing they need to snooze soundly. It blocks out light while applying gentle pressure across the head, hence why the brand describes it as a ""weighted blanket for your eyes."" Thousands of well-rested Amazon reviewers gush that it's changed their sleep game, including a night-shift nurse who called it a ""marvelous little invention"" and said it ""stays put even if you're a side sleeper."" $27 at Ulta orastone Orastone Rechargeable Hand Warmer This rechargeable hand warmer has racked up more than 6,000 Amazon reviews and a 4.6-star rating — and shoppers rave about how quickly it heats up, how toasty it gets and, yes, how cute it is. It reaches over 100 degrees in under two minutes, fits comfortably in your palm and comes in fun patterns with a handy wrist strap. $24 at Amazon Best white elephant gifts for kids and teens Amazon Rubik’s Phantom Cube There's more than meets the eye here. The black tiles will change color with the heat of touch, presenting the puzzler with quite the challenge: solving the cube before the whole thing fades back to black. Part gag gift, part brain-bender, this cube is a true challenge for serious cubers — but a fun one at that! $9 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $9 at Target$20 at Ace Hardware Amazon Flip 7 Card Game Card games are always a white elephant winner, but I'd steer clear of the classics since there's a good chance the recipient already has them. My suggestion: Go with the deck that's currently dominating the Amazon charts. Meet Flip 7, a fast-paced game where you try to reach 200 points without getting any duplicate cards. Sure, there's plenty of strategy involved, but it's really a test of how much you're willing to push your luck. $8 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $8 at Target$10 at CVS Pharmacy Amazon Schylling NeeDoh Ramen Noodlies Let them squish, twist and toss these sensory strings, er, noodles to their heart's content. Throw them into a sensory bin to really get their juices flowing, or play with them as-is. Both are equally as fun.

But researchers have long known that plastic cutting boards are one of the ways microplastics and nanoplastics (MNPs) make it into our bodies. So, what are the best nontoxic cutting boards you can switch to?



First, here's some more background on why you might want to replace your old boards: In March 2024, a landmark study showed that microplastics can be found in plaque that builds up in people's arteries, increasing their risk of cardiovascular events such as stroke and heart attack. This brought a renewed focus to the ways plastic can get into our systems — and it appears that our plastic cutting boards are one of the culprits.



""We know that exposure to plastics, often at surprisingly low thresholds, is linked to greater risk of adverse health outcomes like stroke and heart attack,"" says Varun Subramaniam, associate scientist at the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit that provides consumers with information related to potential toxins in commercial products. ""We're also finding that these tiny plastic particles can penetrate our natural defense barriers and enter our organs, potentially causing inflammation, uncontrolled cell growth and immune disruption.""



The process by which minuscule bits of plastic can get into our systems is quite simple, says Subramaniam. ""Chopping causes plastic fragments to dislodge from the board and stick to foods that we consume. This is a rather significant source of plastics in foods — some studies estimate up to 50.7 grams of plastic consumed per person per year is from cutting boards alone.""



And the longer the boards have been in our house, the greater the risk. ""Risk increases as plastic cutting boards develop grooves, which can release more microplastics into food and harbor bacteria,"" says Wesley McWhorter, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. ""Regularly inspecting and replacing worn boards, especially those with deep scratches, is a practical way to mitigate this risk.""



But, Subramaniam warns, ""even brand-new or barely used plastic cutting boards can release a concerning amount of plastic into our foods."" Safer alternatives include bamboo and wood, which ""are durable and, in the case of wood, have natural antimicrobial properties,"" says McWhorter. ""In my home, I use bamboo for fruits and vegetables and high-density plastic for raw proteins to balance safety and functionality."" This is an important thing to note: There needs to be a give-and-take between safety and practical day-to-day life, and those are decisions that ultimately you as the consumer has to make.



""Making lifestyle changes depends on one's circumstances,"" says Subramaniam. ""However, for those that can do so, these findings warrant switching over from plastic cutting boards to alternatives like ones made from wood or bamboo."" Fortunately, that switch can be made relatively inexpensively. See our list below for options in every price point.

Best materials to replace plastic cutting boards

Hardwood cutting boards

Hardwood is an excellent material to use for cutting boards because it's soft enough to prevent damage to knives while remaining hard enough to resist damage from knives. It's also less porous than softwood, making it durable, long-lasting and resistant to damage. Also, many woods are naturally antimicrobial and antiviral, and there's some evidence that bacterias are less likely to grow on wood surfaces than on plastic ones, although more research needs to be done. Popular options for hardwood cutting boards include:

Advertisement Advertisement

Maple

Walnut

Birch

Acacia

Teak

Oak

Bamboo cutting boards

Bamboo is a great choice because it is sustainable and less porous than hardwoods. It's also harder to scar, which makes it less likely to trap bacteria. Just like with wood cutting boards, be sure to clean bamboo with hot, soapy water and to sanitize periodically. Prime with mineral oil every now and then for longevity.

Paper composite cutting boards

A newcomer to the cutting board market is paper composite. These boards are made from recycled paper that's mixed with food-safe resin then compacted to form the cutting surface. Given that they're not actually wood, they're dishwasher safe and don't have to be oiled to maintain their surface.

Rice fiber or wheat straw fiber cutting boards

Like paper composite boards, rice fiber and wheat straw fiber boards are a new entry in the cutting board world, but they show a lot of promise. Made from rice husks or wheat straw husks, they're eco-friendly, biodegradable, dishwasher safe (generally, although many manufacturers suggest you hand-wash them for longevity) and won't dull or damage your knives.

Glass or stone cutting boards

Glass or stone cutting boards are beneficial for their non-porous surfaces that are easy to clean and (most) can be thrown in the dishwasher. That said, these extra-hard surfaces can be damaging to knives, dulling their edges quickly.

How to clean, care for and use your cutting boards correctly

Regardless of the type of cutting board you select, to ensure food safety you should always follow certain guidelines. Food safety experts recommend that you:

Advertisement Advertisement

Designate specific cutting boards for meat, poultry and seafood and other cutting boards for vegetables or fruits to avoid cross contamination.

Wash with hot, soapy water after each use and dry with a clean towel.

Periodically sanitize wood and other boards made out of porous materials with a solution that is 1 tablespoon bleach to a gallon of water. Pour over the entire surface of the board and allow it to absorb for five minutes before rinsing clean.

Replace cutting boards that are well-worn or have deep grooves where bacteria can make a home and resist your cleaning efforts.

Prime wood and bamboo boards with food-safe mineral oil periodically to maintain their performance.

FAQs

How do I find a safe replacement for my plastic cutting board?

There are pros and cons to just about every cutting board option. However, hardwood and bamboo cutting boards are tried-and-true cutting board solutions that won't dull or damage your knives, provide long-lasting durability and are unlikely to allow for bacterial build-up when cleaned and cared for correctly. You may also want to try new composite cutting boards made from paper, wheat straw or rice husks. These options are eco-friendly, biodegradable and because they're not made from plastic, they won't contribute to microplastic consumption in your foods. They're also convenient, as they're usually dishwasher safe, but be sure to check the manufacturers cleaning suggestions.

Is cutting meat on wooden cutting boards safe?

Yes, as long as you're cleaning and maintaining your wooden cutting boards correctly and following food safety guidelines, cutting meat on hardwood cutting boards is considered safe. While woods can be porous, hardwoods are less porous than softwoods and most wood has natural antibacterial and antiviral properties that can help prevent bacterial growth. Plus, when washed with hot, soapy water immediately following use and disinfected regularly, any risk for bacterial contamination can be prevented.

Are glass cutting boards a better alternative to plastic cutting boards?

While glass cutting boards can be convenient — they're non-porous, easy to clean and dishwasher safe — there are drawbacks. For example, the hard surface isn't great for your knives, which can cause them to wear down quickly.

But researchers have long known that plastic cutting boards are one of the ways microplastics and nanoplastics (MNPs) make it into our bodies. So, what are the best nontoxic cutting boards you can switch to? First, here's some more background on why you might want to replace your old boards: In March 2024, a landmark study showed that microplastics can be found in plaque that builds up in people's arteries, increasing their risk of cardiovascular events such as stroke and heart attack. This brought a renewed focus to the ways plastic can get into our systems — and it appears that our plastic cutting boards are one of the culprits. ""We know that exposure to plastics, often at surprisingly low thresholds, is linked to greater risk of adverse health outcomes like stroke and heart attack,"" says Varun Subramaniam, associate scientist at the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit that provides consumers with information related to potential toxins in commercial products. ""We're also finding that these tiny plastic particles can penetrate our natural defense barriers and enter our organs, potentially causing inflammation, uncontrolled cell growth and immune disruption."" The process by which minuscule bits of plastic can get into our systems is quite simple, says Subramaniam. ""Chopping causes plastic fragments to dislodge from the board and stick to foods that we consume. This is a rather significant source of plastics in foods — some studies estimate up to 50.7 grams of plastic consumed per person per year is from cutting boards alone."" And the longer the boards have been in our house, the greater the risk. ""Risk increases as plastic cutting boards develop grooves, which can release more microplastics into food and harbor bacteria,"" says Wesley McWhorter, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. ""Regularly inspecting and replacing worn boards, especially those with deep scratches, is a practical way to mitigate this risk."" But, Subramaniam warns, ""even brand-new or barely used plastic cutting boards can release a concerning amount of plastic into our foods."" Safer alternatives include bamboo and wood, which ""are durable and, in the case of wood, have natural antimicrobial properties,"" says McWhorter. ""In my home, I use bamboo for fruits and vegetables and high-density plastic for raw proteins to balance safety and functionality."" This is an important thing to note: There needs to be a give-and-take between safety and practical day-to-day life, and those are decisions that ultimately you as the consumer has to make. ""Making lifestyle changes depends on one's circumstances,"" says Subramaniam. ""However, for those that can do so, these findings warrant switching over from plastic cutting boards to alternatives like ones made from wood or bamboo."" Fortunately, that switch can be made relatively inexpensively. See our list below for options in every price point.

Designate one for proteins, the other for produce and your kitchen prep game will be good to go. Just keep in mind that while most rice fiber kitchenware is dishwasher safe, the manufacturer suggests hand-washing only for this set of boards. $30 at Amazon Best materials to replace plastic cutting boards Hardwood cutting boards Hardwood is an excellent material to use for cutting boards because it's soft enough to prevent damage to knives while remaining hard enough to resist damage from knives. It's also less porous than softwood, making it durable, long-lasting and resistant to damage. Also, many woods are naturally antimicrobial and antiviral, and there's some evidence that bacterias are less likely to grow on wood surfaces than on plastic ones, although more research needs to be done. Popular options for hardwood cutting boards include: Advertisement Advertisement Maple Walnut Birch Acacia Teak Oak Bamboo cutting boards Bamboo is a great choice because it is sustainable and less porous than hardwoods. It's also harder to scar, which makes it less likely to trap bacteria. Just like with wood cutting boards, be sure to clean bamboo with hot, soapy water and to sanitize periodically. Prime with mineral oil every now and then for longevity. Paper composite cutting boards A newcomer to the cutting board market is paper composite. These boards are made from recycled paper that's mixed with food-safe resin then compacted to form the cutting surface. Given that they're not actually wood, they're dishwasher safe and don't have to be oiled to maintain their surface. Rice fiber or wheat straw fiber cutting boards Like paper composite boards, rice fiber and wheat straw fiber boards are a new entry in the cutting board world, but they show a lot of promise. Made from rice husks or wheat straw husks, they're eco-friendly, biodegradable, dishwasher safe (generally, although many manufacturers suggest you hand-wash them for longevity) and won't dull or damage your knives. Glass or stone cutting boards Glass or stone cutting boards are beneficial for their non-porous surfaces that are easy to clean and (most) can be thrown in the dishwasher. That said, these extra-hard surfaces can be damaging to knives, dulling their edges quickly. How to clean, care for and use your cutting boards correctly Regardless of the type of cutting board you select, to ensure food safety you should always follow certain guidelines. Food safety experts recommend that you: Advertisement Advertisement Designate specific cutting boards for meat, poultry and seafood and other cutting boards for vegetables or fruits to avoid cross contamination. Wash with hot, soapy water after each use and dry with a clean towel. Periodically sanitize wood and other boards made out of porous materials with a solution that is 1 tablespoon bleach to a gallon of water. Pour over the entire surface of the board and allow it to absorb for five minutes before rinsing clean. Replace cutting boards that are well-worn or have deep grooves where bacteria can make a home and resist your cleaning efforts. Prime wood and bamboo boards with food-safe mineral oil periodically to maintain their performance. FAQs How do I find a safe replacement for my plastic cutting board? There are pros and cons to just about every cutting board option. However, hardwood and bamboo cutting boards are tried-and-true cutting board solutions that won't dull or damage your knives, provide long-lasting durability and are unlikely to allow for bacterial build-up when cleaned and cared for correctly. You may also want to try new composite cutting boards made from paper, wheat straw or rice husks. These options are eco-friendly, biodegradable and because they're not made from plastic, they won't contribute to microplastic consumption in your foods. They're also convenient, as they're usually dishwasher safe, but be sure to check the manufacturers cleaning suggestions. Is cutting meat on wooden cutting boards safe? Yes, as long as you're cleaning and maintaining your wooden cutting boards correctly and following food safety guidelines, cutting meat on hardwood cutting boards is considered safe. While woods can be porous, hardwoods are less porous than softwoods and most wood has natural antibacterial and antiviral properties that can help prevent bacterial growth. Plus, when washed with hot, soapy water immediately following use and disinfected regularly, any risk for bacterial contamination can be prevented. Are glass cutting boards a better alternative to plastic cutting boards? While glass cutting boards can be convenient — they're non-porous, easy to clean and dishwasher safe — there are drawbacks.

(Amazon)

Lugging around a big, clunky vacuum? We'd rather not, thanks. The best cordless stick vacuums deliver as much — if not more — cleaning power as their bulky counterparts, but are significantly lighter in weight and more nimble. Many can even transform into a handheld vacuum, allowing you to suck up every speck of dust and dirt, no matter where it's hiding.



As Yahoo's resident cleaning expert, I've tested more than 60 of the best vacuums over the past few years (including lightweight models and vacuums designed specifically for pet hair). For this guide, I tested 14 of the best cordless stick vacuums, putting these machines through their paces against a range of floor surfaces and materials. I set up obstacle courses to see how well they could bob and weave and tackled stairs, sofas and other spots with their various attachment tools. In the end, I settled on four glowing (sometimes, literally!) models across various budgets and needs.

Best cordless stick vacuums for 2025

Tineco Best cordless stick vacuum overall Tineco Pure ONE S11 Cordless Vacuum Size: 6.22""L x 12.05""W x 29.68""H | Weight: 7.1 pounds | Bin capacity: 0.6 liters | Run time: 40 minutes | Filter: Yes | Power: 450 watts Leading my list is the Tineco Pure One S11 Smart Stick, which hit the sweet spot in my testing for a sleek vacuum that offers solid performance, along with some snazzy features, at a competitive price. For just about $300, the Tineco Pure One S11 features a narrow brush head that swivels like a dream. It has headlights for seeing under low furniture and in darker spaces. At 7 pounds, the S11 is also lightweight and, as several eavesdroppers noted during my testing, incredibly quiet — enough that it probably wouldn't wake a sleeping baby. The suction was superb in my ""carpet course"" test (more details toward the end of this guide), with the Pure One S11 mowing down faux fur, sand, kitty litter, rice and cereal with ease. It only took one pass to pick up the latter from hardwood surfaces, including most if not all materials pushed up against or crushed into wall trims. Cat hair was no obstacle, and the S11 was able to get all of the dog fur in my ""passenger pet"" test (though it may require an extra go for fur that's matted into dense carpets). In real-life trials, I was able to cover several rooms — or the first floor of a house, plus stairs and some curtain detailing — in what proved a true run time of 40 minutes. Tineco’s S11 boasts a HEPA filter, two power modes (you don't need to hold the switch the whole time you're cleaning) and an LCD screen that displays important reminders, such as when the filter needs swapping. A color-coded ring indicates battery life and tells you when your floor is truly clean. Bonus: The vacuum connects to Tineco's smart app for Wi-Fi enabling and additional features. The dust cup is a cinch to pop open and offers 0.6 liters of space, so you don’t have to keep emptying it. There’s a mini power brush and additional attachments for navigating tight spaces and upholstery. You can set up the included wall mount to charge your vacuum standing or charge the upper vacuum head portion independently (one gripe: you'll need to dock it in the wall mount, as that’s where the outlet wire plugs in). Pros Narrow brush head with lighting for visibility

LCD display with Wi-Fi connectivity

Comes with a mini brush head and other attachments Cons Doesn't display exact battery percentage

Kenmore Best value cordless stick vacuum Kenmore Elite Cordless Stick Vacuum Size: 15.75""L x 5.71""W x 21.46""H | Weight: 6 pounds | Bin capacity: 1 liter | Run time: 40 minutes | Filter: Yes | Power: 250 watts For an even lighter lift (both financially and physically), the Kenmore Elite Stick Vacuum performed at the peak of my lowest price category, with a shiny frame and a brush cleaner head that has four light bulbs for added visibility. In testing, I referred to it as ""Tinker Bell"" because it moved swiftly, yet gently and glowed like a fairy. It was easy to set up — three main parts, three clicks — and can be charged in the wall mount dock or plugged right into an outlet. It contains a HEPA filter for capturing 99.97% of pixie (er, dust) particles and features an LCD display that illuminates different colors to indicate charge level and motor speed. You use the switch to start and stop, and can toggle between modes via the button on top (no need to keep holding). The Kenmore Elite offers 40 minutes of run time, which I found accurate and sufficient for tackling several rooms at a time, and performed on par with the Pure One S11 in terms of suction and trimming, only sparing a few deeply creviced rice grains in my “kitchen sink” testing. For being so lightweight — only 6 pounds, with the handheld portion only 3 — the Kenmore Elite has the second biggest dust cup of the vacuums I tested, with a sophisticated release functionality similar to Dyson. The tube is also flexible for getting under shallow areas without having to bend over, making it especially helpful for individuals who have — or don't want — back problems. (Small snag: The Elite only comes with one attachment tool compared to some of my other options, though you can purchase additional accessories without breaking the bank.) Pros Narrow brush head with lighting for visibility

Flexible tube for navigating shallow areas

Sizable dust cup with sophisticated release

Color-coded display ring with motor speed and battery life indicators Cons Doesn’t have battery percentage reads

Shark Best cordless stick vacuum for carpets Shark Stratos Cordless Stick Vacuum Size: 13.78""L x 10.24""W x 51.18""H | Weight: 8.9 pounds | Bin capacity: 0.7 liters | Run time: 60 minutes | Filter: Yes | Power: 309 watts Dominating the mid-priced range is the Shark Stratos Cordless Stick Vacuum, which manages to be a lot of things, among them — and especially when it comes to carpets — a total pickup artist. The Stratos' cleaner head is stocked with two brushes — one that grips into rugs and another that pulls in smaller particles on surfaces for additional polishing. It promises the strongest suction of any Shark cordless stick and it delivered — against the other Shark I tested and most of the other brands on my list. While it showed its true prowess in my ""passenger pet"" test, lifting stubborn pet hairs from dense car mats in one mesmerizing pass, the Stratos also performed well on hard floors, eliminating Cheerios, rice and sand in a single swoop and devouring smaller particles against trims and cabinets. Among the Stratos' bells and whistles are an odor diffuser, headlights and an LCD screen that displays battery life and lets you know when the floor is truly clean. At 0.7 liters, the dust cup is pretty generous, and there’s a release lever for added convenience. Unique to all other vacuums I tested, the Stratos is an automatic, meaning it adjusts modes to provide the amount of suction you need while preserving battery life (it offers 60 minutes with a full charge, which allowed me to tackle several cleans while alternating between modes and handheld use in between). Unique to other non-Shark vacuums I tested, the brush cleaner head can be hinged at a 90° angle so it doesn't dangle when you transfer it from room to room. And with the center of the tube folded down and the vacuum head plugged in, you can charge the Stratos in its entirety, right in place, wherever there's an outlet present.

Dyson Best cordless stick vacuum for hardwood floors Dyson V12 Detect Slim Origin Cordless Vacuum Cleaner Size: 9.9""L x 9.8""W x 49.1""H | Weight: 5.22 pounds | Bin capacity: 0.34 liters | Run time: 60 minutes | Filter: Yes | Power: 150 watts Last but certainly not least is the Dyson V12 Detect Slim, which is a lean, mean — sometimes fluorescent green! — cleaning machine. Like all the Dyson models I tested, the Dyson V12 Detect Slim consists of three main pieces: a vacuum head upper (handheld portion), a long tube and a brush cleaner head. You can put it together in a matter of seconds and charge it using the wall mount or by plugging the vacuum head right into an outlet. Dyson’s HEPA filters are washable for easy maintenance, and their dust cup levers eject debris with force, so there’s not much (if any) manual cleanup. The Dyson V12 Detect Slim comes with the brand’s traditional suite of accessories, including a crevice tool and a mini anti-screw brush tool for tackling couch cushions, car interiors and other nooks and crannies. What sets this stick apart from some Dyson models (like the Dyson V8) is that it offers 60 minutes of runtime and has a sophisticated LCD screen with battery life, modes, and cleaning reads. What sets it apart from most Dyson models is that it’s powered with a push button (meaning you don’t have to keep pressing the operating switch). But what I really geeked out on, and why I'm choosing the V12 Detect Slim for my hardwood category, is that it comes with a special fluffy brush roller — complete with a neon green light that illuminates everything in its path — for hard surfaces specifically. It got every bit of material in my“kitchen sink” test, no matter how small or creviced the grain. Because the roller is soft and the brush cleaner head is narrow and nimble, I was able to use it against walls and in tighter spaces, such as around bathroom toilets, without having to swap in different attachments or worry about banging up baseboards. At just over 5 pounds, this sleek specimen also happens to be the most lightweight I tested, gliding over hardwood surfaces gently but swiftly without scuffing them. I felt like I was in the latest ""Ghostbusters"" movie when using this (it's that cool) and referred to it as ""the closer"" because I relied on it to zap any materials left behind during testing segments (I’ve continued to use it in my apartment, which is hardwood save for some throw rugs, since). My only complaint is that the dust cup is among the smaller ones on my list. That, and the fact that the soft brush is, well, sort of addictive to use. Shopping tip: I opted for the Dyson V12 Detect Slim here because it’s the most affordable and lightweight of the brand’s “Detect” family (that, and the press button is super convenient). The traditional anti-tangle brush cleared hair and other materials from carpets. If you’d like a little more carpet traction (say for really thick rugs or homes with pets), the Dyson V15 Detect and Dyson Gen5detect offer the same illuminating fluffy brush, but with larger dust cups, more suction power and an optimizable anti-tangle cleaner brush head with three surface settings (something that made a difference in my “passenger pet” test). Additionally, the Gen5detect boasts an extra ten minutes of run time, plus an On/Off button, for those who prefer to be more hands-free. Keep scrolling for more info on the Dyson cordless stick vacuums I evaluated. Pros Slim fluffy cleaner head with laser for hardwood visibility

Factors to consider when choosing a cordless stick vacuum

Size: Higher stick vacuums generally equate to longer tubes and greater reach, particularly helpful for those who are tall or navigating vast, shallow surface areas (like beneath platform beds). That said, more height means you’ll be farther from your target, in which case extendable or flexible tubes can help with maneuverability (and lights can help with visibility). Longer brush rolls mean fewer swipes for wider floors but they may need turning when tackling narrow areas, such as under a small nightstand. Wider brushes require shorter strokes for longer floors but may necessitate additional swipes for wider surfaces.



Weight: The lighter the vacuum, the easier the lift (and steer). Lightweight designs glide across hardwood floors seamlessly but can have a difficult time bearing down on, say, thick carpets. Lighter models tend to be associated with smaller dust cups, though not always, and fewer tech components (like LCD screens and respective engineering that can prove top-heavy).



Cup capacity: Larger cups house more dirt so you don’t have to take as many trips to the trash can. Most of the stick vacuums I scouted — and tested — fell between 0.4 and 0.8 liters, with the Kenmore Elite at 1 liter plus and the Dyson Outsize taking the lead with almost 2 liters. Aside from capacity, I preferred cups with lids that opened automatically with the help of a lever (usually on the side or along the backside of the bin) versus having to manually unclip the lids and, in some cases, having to reach my fingers in.



Glow-getter: The Dyson V12 Detect Slim’s soft brush illuminates everything in its path fluorescent green — and it's fun to see! (Kristin Granero/Yahoo Life) (Dyson)

Runtime: According to my research, the average cordless stick vacuum runtime hovers around 30 to 40 minutes for a budget-friendly model, 40 to 50 minutes for mid-priced and 50 minutes or above for luxury, with the Dyson Gen5detect topping my list at 70 minutes. I suggest at least 40 to 50 minutes for multi-floor jobs, and thorough cleanings incorporating ""max"" modes and attachments. Most of the cordless stick vacuum cleaners I tried require four(ish) hours of charging to reach full battery potential.



Filter type: A lot of cordless stick vacuums available today are equipped with a filter for zapping pollutants and improving air quality, with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters considered the gold standard. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), HEPA filters ""theoretically remove at least 99.97% of dust, pollen, mold, bacteria and any airborne particles with a size of 0.3 microns,"" with larger or smaller particles “trapped with even higher efficiency.” Follow instruction manuals for how and when to replace filters for optimal results (many, like Dyson, now use washable filters for cost efficiency).



Wattage: A higher wattage often correlates to greater suction power. High-voltage batteries generally have a longer shelf life, or runtime, so you can tackle more space or several vacuum jobs in one go without recharging.



Brushes and attachments: Most of the cordless stick vacuums I tested come with a detangling brush roller that can be used for multiple floor types including carpets, some with an additional soft brush roller for hard surfaces. Brush cleaner headlights offer more visibility in low lighting and beneath furniture, while mini roller attachments help tackle tighter spaces (such as inside your car; they’re also great for getting stubborn pet fur from couch interiors). Brush tools aid in detailing and spot-treating (cushions, curtains), whereas crevice tools are a must for navigating ceilings and wall corners.



Docking and storing: With freestanding docks, you don't have to screw a wall mount into place to keep your stick vacuum upright. Alternatively, all of the vacuum head ""uppers"" on this list can be charged separately via plug. You just have to then reattach them to the vacuum tube and cleaner head base when finished.

No mount, no problem: The Tineco Pure One S15 comes with a freestanding, preassembled dock. The Shark Stratos tucks down and relies on its cleaner head as a base, for mobile stationing. (Kristin Granero/Yahoo Life)

How we tested cordless stick vacuums

I set up several obstacle courses to test these cordless stick vacuums against materials with varying shapes, textures and depths on different surfaces (carpet and hardwood) and their respective attachments on sofa and other upholsteries. Additionally, I put them through their paces in real-life scenarios, prioritizing homes that needed a good cleaning and/or had pet inhabitants. The nitty gritty:

""Carpet course"" test: I spaced out materials — faux fur, rice, Cheerios, kitty litter and sand — across a plush carpet to see how the vacuums managed to cut through the clutter.

""Kitchen sink"" test: I poured rice and Cheerios on a hardwood kitchen floor to gauge how well the vacuums could get a grip — especially against trims and in cabinet crevices.

""Passenger pet"" test: I asked family and friends to avoid vacuuming for a week, then used car mats to collect the fur their pet companions had shed, to see which vacuums had the best suction.

""Vacs gone wild"" test: I didn’t stop there! I clocked over 30 hours testing these vacuums in different houses and settings to see if they could rise to different occasions.

Risky business: I sucked up faux fur, rice, kitty litter, Cheerios and sand on a plush carpet for one of my ""Carpet Course"" tests. (Kristin Granero/Yahoo Life)

Other cordless stick vacuums we tested

Dyson V8 Cordless Stick Vacuum: This is among Dyson's more compact and budget-conscious Dyson models and a touch taller and longer than the V7 with a slightly wider brush head and a bit more pickup. The vacuum maneuvers effortlessly over and around rugs and hardwood floors, and the hair screw tool worked miracles when it came to tight corners and detailing pet-loved couch interiors. The carpet suction isn't on the level of what I found with Dyson’s adjustable brush cleaner head (more below). Because of this, combined with the smaller dust cup (0.4 liters) and shorter runtime (40 minutes; I clocked 25 minutes when toggling between the higher power mode), I suggest it for smaller spaces with hardwood floors or shallow carpets and quicker jobs. Of note, the V8 doesn't have a digital display with battery life readings, so you don't know when it’s going to stop.

Dyson V11 Cordless Stick Vacuum: With this vac, you get the same roller brush, attachments and operation style as the V8 but with a tad taller and heavier yet still incredibly nimble frame (yay, upgrades!). For around a $90 price increase (before sales), you get extended runtime (60 minutes total) and a bigger cup size, ideal for tackling multiple rooms (I also found the cup release lever, located on the underbelly of the bin, more effective at ridding waste than the V8). Plus, you get an LCD interface displaying power modes — in this case, three — along with battery life readings for keeping track of your juice.

Dyson Outsize Cordless Stick Vacuum: Essentially a jumbo-sized Dyson (hence the name), this vac is the tallest and has the longest, widest brush roller, plus the largest cup capacity, of the Dyson vacuums I tried. It functions similarly to the Dyson V11 (there’s an LCD screen, three modes and a 60-minute runtime; the attachments are the same), but the Outsize has an adjustable cleaner head that allows you to toggle between three settings. The ""-"" optimizes performance for hardwood floors and the ""+"" offers better traction on carpets, a difference that really stood out in my ""kitchen sink"" and ""carpet course"" tests. It's a worthy splurge for bigger homes and wide, open spaces such as basements.

Dyson V15 Detect: This Dyson is slightly heavier and pricier than the Dyson V12 Detect Slim, equipped with the same attachments, runtime, LCD screen and neon-emitting fluffy brush, which comes in handy when you want to do a deep cleaning. As mentioned above, it has a larger dust cup (0.8 liters), a bit more pickup (240 watts) and an adjustable anti-tangle roller brush that can be optimized for hardwood (""-"") or thick rug (""+"") surfaces, which appeared to make a difference in my traditional ""kitchen sink"" and ""passenger pet"" tests. The catch? As with most Dyson stick vacuums, you need to continuously press the V15 Detect's power switch to keep it going.

Dyson's gen5Detect: You'll get the same bells and whistles as the Dyson V15 Detect — a detangling digital cleaner head and fluffy laser cleaner head, attachments and equal dust cup capacity — with slightly more power and a battery life of 70 minutes. The digital readouts are a nudge more sophisticated and — unique to all of the Dyson vacuums I tested except one — there’s a Start/Stop button versus a switch. It can be a little awkward to press the top button with one hand in the handle groove, and the vacuum is slightly top-heavy, but the button means you can relax your finger as you move. I would have given this best overall from a pure performance standpoint if I didn't consider price as a factor for the category.

Sleek lineup: A selection of non-Dyson cordless stick vacuums prepare to go head-to-head in a range of tests to determine the best. (Kristin Granero/Yahoo Life)

Tineco Pure One S15 Pet Smart Stick Vacuum (currently out of stock): This delivers one of the sleekest designs and smartest digital displays in its price range. Like many of the other vacuums on this list, it can be set up in a matter of seconds and comes with an equally minimalistic-looking, freestanding charging mount that requires no assembly. The LCD screen is similar to the Pure One S11, with Wi-Fi connectivity and a color-coded halo to distinguish the level of cleanliness, plus battery reads, and the brush cleaner head has ample light for visibility. As evident in our ""passenger pet"" test, the suction is a bit stronger than the Tineco Pure One S11 (just behind the Dyson and Shark vacuums I tested) and attachments include a mini anti-tangle brush for getting into grooves. Of note: there were a few instances where the S15 had trouble holding down its meals, spitting out finer particles such as rice from our ""kitchen sink"" test (should you want to vacuum up such things).

Shark Rocket Pet Pro Cordless Stick Vacuum: It has some of the most powerful suction of the cordless stick vacuums I tried. In ""boost"" mode, comparable or just behind the Dyson Detects and Shark Stratos in our ""passenger pet"" test. In our ""kitchen sink"" test, regardless of the mode, it gobbled everything in its path — even down to finer Cheerio pieces and (most) rice particles in cabinet edges. Like the Stratos, it has a headlight for visibility and you can hinge the tube and brush cleaner head for controlled carrying; you don't need a wall mount to charge it standing. I like how the Samsung Stratos automatically adjusts its modes based on the job at hand (for the Rocket, you select between ""hardwood"" and ""carpet"" modes but have to hold the ""boost"" lever throughout) — and offers 20 additional minutes of run time. All things considered, the Rocket is still a solid choice for pet owners or anyone else who's looking for serious pickup on a smaller-than-Dyson dime. Note, however, this vacuum is currently out of stock.

Bissell's IconPet Cordless Stick Vacuum: This stick vacuum is designed with an anti-tangle brush and a glowy LED brush cleaner headlight that illuminates fur and other fine fibers. It fell in the mid-range for weight (8 pounds) and cup size (0.4 liters) amidst my testing group and navigated regular carpets and hardwood floors just fine. It boasts an LED crevice and dusting brush tool and mini LED brush tool for added visibility and versatility. But the IconPet didn’t perform as well as some vacuums in my ""passenger pet"" test, requiring a few passes to get the fur out of the car mats. In the ""kitchen sink"" test, it had some trouble swallowing Cheerios, spitting them out here and there. In ""turbo"" mode, this baby sounds like a turbojet, so I wouldn’t recommend using it if someone is sleeping or you have very thin walls.

Hoover OnePwr Blade+ (currently out of stock): Easy to put together and operate, this vacuum lets you charge the battery on its own without the vacuum head for added convenience. With the brush cleaner headlight on, it performed great in my “carpet course"" test and fine in my ""kitchen sink"" test (save for some smaller particles here and there, usually against ledges). It struggled without the cleaner brush headlight on, however, stumbling on Cheerios and skipping particles of sand. It got clogged a few times and released some materials through the cleaner head while in use or when shuffled from room to room. Additionally, I wish the cup size were bigger (it’s only 0.3 liters) and that I didn’t have to unclip it from the rest of the vacuum for emptying (though it’s a clean release, so I didn't need to put my hands in).

Cordless stick vacuum FAQs

What is the difference between a stick vacuum and an upright vacuum?

Stick vacuums typically consist of a vacuum head, complete with a battery, dust cup, filter, control buttons, and sometimes a digital display screen (think of the head, or “upper,” as its central processing and operating unit). The head attaches to a thin tube, which then connects to a brush cleaner head with roller(s). Alternatively, the ""upper"" can be attached to various attachment tools (versus the tube) for handheld use.

Like many upright vacuums designed today, stick vacuums are often bagless (thanks to their dust cups), the biggest distinguisher being that stick vacuums are usually cordless. Because of this, you can move them around a room or home freely, though you’ll have to charge — and are limited to — the battery. Given their svelte silhouettes, cordless stick vacuums also tend to be more nimble and storage-friendly.

Are stick vacuums heavy?

Not typically. Part of what makes stick vacuums so nimble is that they’re generally lightweight. Most of the stick vacuums I evaluated weigh in at around 6 or 7 pounds when completely configured, with Kenmore Elite and Homeika Pro handhelds weighing in at just over 3 (meaning fewer back aches and less elbow grease).

Are stick vacuums good for the carpet?

Because cordless stick vacuums tend to be lighter and less powerful than corded upright vacuums, they are thought not to “hunker down” quite like corded upright vacuums. That said, I experienced good rug traction with the models I tested, especially when it came to Tineco (may need an extra pass), Shark (hold your throws!) and Dyson (the V8 and V11 being adequate, with the Dyson Outsize, Dyson V15 Detect and Dyson Gen5detect including ""+"" toggle on the brush head for even greater suction power against plush carpets).

(Amazon) Lugging around a big, clunky vacuum? We'd rather not, thanks. The best cordless stick vacuums deliver as much — if not more — cleaning power as their bulky counterparts, but are significantly lighter in weight and more nimble. Many can even transform into a handheld vacuum, allowing you to suck up every speck of dust and dirt, no matter where it's hiding. As Yahoo's resident cleaning expert, I've tested more than 60 of the best vacuums over the past few years (including lightweight models and vacuums designed specifically for pet hair). For this guide, I tested 14 of the best cordless stick vacuums, putting these machines through their paces against a range of floor surfaces and materials. I set up obstacle courses to see how well they could bob and weave and tackled stairs, sofas and other spots with their various attachment tools. In the end, I settled on four glowing (sometimes, literally!) models across various budgets and needs. Best cordless stick vacuums for 2025 Tineco Best cordless stick vacuum overall Tineco Pure ONE S11 Cordless Vacuum Size: 6.22""L x 12.05""W x 29.68""H | Weight: 7.1 pounds | Bin capacity: 0.6 liters | Run time: 40 minutes | Filter: Yes | Power: 450 watts Leading my list is the Tineco Pure One S11 Smart Stick, which hit the sweet spot in my testing for a sleek vacuum that offers solid performance, along with some snazzy features, at a competitive price. For just about $300, the Tineco Pure One S11 features a narrow brush head that swivels like a dream. It has headlights for seeing under low furniture and in darker spaces. At 7 pounds, the S11 is also lightweight and, as several eavesdroppers noted during my testing, incredibly quiet — enough that it probably wouldn't wake a sleeping baby. The suction was superb in my ""carpet course"" test (more details toward the end of this guide), with the Pure One S11 mowing down faux fur, sand, kitty litter, rice and cereal with ease. It only took one pass to pick up the latter from hardwood surfaces, including most if not all materials pushed up against or crushed into wall trims. Cat hair was no obstacle, and the S11 was able to get all of the dog fur in my ""passenger pet"" test (though it may require an extra go for fur that's matted into dense carpets). In real-life trials, I was able to cover several rooms — or the first floor of a house, plus stairs and some curtain detailing — in what proved a true run time of 40 minutes. Tineco’s S11 boasts a HEPA filter, two power modes (you don't need to hold the switch the whole time you're cleaning) and an LCD screen that displays important reminders, such as when the filter needs swapping. A color-coded ring indicates battery life and tells you when your floor is truly clean. Bonus: The vacuum connects to Tineco's smart app for Wi-Fi enabling and additional features. The dust cup is a cinch to pop open and offers 0.6 liters of space, so you don’t have to keep emptying it. There’s a mini power brush and additional attachments for navigating tight spaces and upholstery. You can set up the included wall mount to charge your vacuum standing or charge the upper vacuum head portion independently (one gripe: you'll need to dock it in the wall mount, as that’s where the outlet wire plugs in). Pros Narrow brush head with lighting for visibility LCD display with Wi-Fi connectivity Comes with a mini brush head and other attachments Cons Doesn't display exact battery percentage The wall plug connects to the mount (versus vacuum head) for charging $199 at Amazon Kenmore Best value cordless stick vacuum Kenmore Elite Cordless Stick Vacuum Size: 15.75""L x 5.71""W x 21.46""H | Weight: 6 pounds | Bin capacity: 1 liter | Run time: 40 minutes | Filter: Yes | Power: 250 watts For an even lighter lift (both financially and physically), the Kenmore Elite Stick Vacuum performed at the peak of my lowest price category, with a shiny frame and a brush cleaner head that has four light bulbs for added visibility. In testing, I referred to it as ""Tinker Bell"" because it moved swiftly, yet gently and glowed like a fairy. It was easy to set up — three main parts, three clicks — and can be charged in the wall mount dock or plugged right into an outlet. It contains a HEPA filter for capturing 99.97% of pixie (er, dust) particles and features an LCD display that illuminates different colors to indicate charge level and motor speed. You use the switch to start and stop, and can toggle between modes via the button on top (no need to keep holding). The Kenmore Elite offers 40 minutes of run time, which I found accurate and sufficient for tackling several rooms at a time, and performed on par with the Pure One S11 in terms of suction and trimming, only sparing a few deeply creviced rice grains in my “kitchen sink” testing. For being so lightweight — only 6 pounds, with the handheld portion only 3 — the Kenmore Elite has the second biggest dust cup of the vacuums I tested, with a sophisticated release functionality similar to Dyson. The tube is also flexible for getting under shallow areas without having to bend over, making it especially helpful for individuals who have — or don't want — back problems. (Small snag: The Elite only comes with one attachment tool compared to some of my other options, though you can purchase additional accessories without breaking the bank.) Pros Narrow brush head with lighting for visibility Flexible tube for navigating shallow areas Sizable dust cup with sophisticated release Color-coded display ring with motor speed and battery life indicators Cons Doesn’t have battery percentage reads Only comes with one attachment tool $100 at Amazon Shark Best cordless stick vacuum for carpets Shark Stratos Cordless Stick Vacuum Size: 13.78""L x 10.24""W x 51.18""H | Weight: 8.9 pounds | Bin capacity: 0.7 liters | Run time: 60 minutes | Filter: Yes | Power: 309 watts Dominating the mid-priced range is the Shark Stratos Cordless Stick Vacuum, which manages to be a lot of things, among them — and especially when it comes to carpets — a total pickup artist. The Stratos' cleaner head is stocked with two brushes — one that grips into rugs and another that pulls in smaller particles on surfaces for additional polishing. It promises the strongest suction of any Shark cordless stick and it delivered — against the other Shark I tested and most of the other brands on my list. While it showed its true prowess in my ""passenger pet"" test, lifting stubborn pet hairs from dense car mats in one mesmerizing pass, the Stratos also performed well on hard floors, eliminating Cheerios, rice and sand in a single swoop and devouring smaller particles against trims and cabinets. Among the Stratos' bells and whistles are an odor diffuser, headlights and an LCD screen that displays battery life and lets you know when the floor is truly clean. At 0.7 liters, the dust cup is pretty generous, and there’s a release lever for added convenience. Unique to all other vacuums I tested, the Stratos is an automatic, meaning it adjusts modes to provide the amount of suction you need while preserving battery life (it offers 60 minutes with a full charge, which allowed me to tackle several cleans while alternating between modes and handheld use in between). Unique to other non-Shark vacuums I tested, the brush cleaner head can be hinged at a 90° angle so it doesn't dangle when you transfer it from room to room. And with the center of the tube folded down and the vacuum head plugged in, you can charge the Stratos in its entirety, right in place, wherever there's an outlet present. Pros Brush cleaner headlights for visibility Flexible tube for navigating shallow areas LED display with battery reads Automatically adjusts to the suction level you need Cons Dual brushes means a wider cleaner head Wish it had a mini, anti-screw-style brush tool $305 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $320 at Chewy$500 at Wayfair Dyson Best cordless stick vacuum for hardwood floors Dyson V12 Detect Slim Origin Cordless Vacuum Cleaner Size: 9.9""L x 9.8""W x 49.1""H | Weight: 5.22 pounds | Bin capacity: 0.34 liters | Run time: 60 minutes | Filter: Yes | Power: 150 watts Last but certainly not least is the Dyson V12 Detect Slim, which is a lean, mean — sometimes fluorescent green! — cleaning machine. Like all the Dyson models I tested, the Dyson V12 Detect Slim consists of three main pieces: a vacuum head upper (handheld portion), a long tube and a brush cleaner head. You can put it together in a matter of seconds and charge it using the wall mount or by plugging the vacuum head right into an outlet. Dyson’s HEPA filters are washable for easy maintenance, and their dust cup levers eject debris with force, so there’s not much (if any) manual cleanup. The Dyson V12 Detect Slim comes with the brand’s traditional suite of accessories, including a crevice tool and a mini anti-screw brush tool for tackling couch cushions, car interiors and other nooks and crannies. What sets this stick apart from some Dyson models (like the Dyson V8) is that it offers 60 minutes of runtime and has a sophisticated LCD screen with battery life, modes, and cleaning reads. What sets it apart from most Dyson models is that it’s powered with a push button (meaning you don’t have to keep pressing the operating switch). But what I really geeked out on, and why I'm choosing the V12 Detect Slim for my hardwood category, is that it comes with a special fluffy brush roller — complete with a neon green light that illuminates everything in its path — for hard surfaces specifically. It got every bit of material in my“kitchen sink” test, no matter how small or creviced the grain. Because the roller is soft and the brush cleaner head is narrow and nimble, I was able to use it against walls and in tighter spaces, such as around bathroom toilets, without having to swap in different attachments or worry about banging up baseboards. At just over 5 pounds, this sleek specimen also happens to be the most lightweight I tested, gliding over hardwood surfaces gently but swiftly without scuffing them. I felt like I was in the latest ""Ghostbusters"" movie when using this (it's that cool) and referred to it as ""the closer"" because I relied on it to zap any materials left behind during testing segments (I’ve continued to use it in my apartment, which is hardwood save for some throw rugs, since). My only complaint is that the dust cup is among the smaller ones on my list. That, and the fact that the soft brush is, well, sort of addictive to use. Shopping tip: I opted for the Dyson V12 Detect Slim here because it’s the most affordable and lightweight of the brand’s “Detect” family (that, and the press button is super convenient). The traditional anti-tangle brush cleared hair and other materials from carpets. If you’d like a little more carpet traction (say for really thick rugs or homes with pets), the Dyson V15 Detect and Dyson Gen5detect offer the same illuminating fluffy brush, but with larger dust cups, more suction power and an optimizable anti-tangle cleaner brush head with three surface settings (something that made a difference in my “passenger pet” test). Additionally, the Gen5detect boasts an extra ten minutes of run time, plus an On/Off button, for those who prefer to be more hands-free. Keep scrolling for more info on the Dyson cordless stick vacuums I evaluated. Pros Slim fluffy cleaner head with laser for hardwood visibility Attachments include a mini hair screw tool for smaller surfaces and tighter spaces Digital display with mode, battery and cleanliness reads Cons Detangling cleaner head doesn’t have lighting Pricey $400 at Dyson Disappearing act: The Shark Stratos eliminates matted dog hair from a car mat in one pass of our ""passenger pet"" test. (Kristin Granero/Yahoo Life) Factors to consider when choosing a cordless stick vacuum Size: Higher stick vacuums generally equate to longer tubes and greater reach, particularly helpful for those who are tall or navigating vast, shallow surface areas (like beneath platform beds). That said, more height means you’ll be farther from your target, in which case extendable or flexible tubes can help with maneuverability (and lights can help with visibility). Longer brush rolls mean fewer swipes for wider floors but they may need turning when tackling narrow areas, such as under a small nightstand. Wider brushes require shorter strokes for longer floors but may necessitate additional swipes for wider surfaces. Weight: The lighter the vacuum, the easier the lift (and steer). Lightweight designs glide across hardwood floors seamlessly but can have a difficult time bearing down on, say, thick carpets. Lighter models tend to be associated with smaller dust cups, though not always, and fewer tech components (like LCD screens and respective engineering that can prove top-heavy). Cup capacity: Larger cups house more dirt so you don’t have to take as many trips to the trash can. Most of the stick vacuums I scouted — and tested — fell between 0.4 and 0.8 liters, with the Kenmore Elite at 1 liter plus and the Dyson Outsize taking the lead with almost 2 liters. Aside from capacity, I preferred cups with lids that opened automatically with the help of a lever (usually on the side or along the backside of the bin) versus having to manually unclip the lids and, in some cases, having to reach my fingers in. Glow-getter: The Dyson V12 Detect Slim’s soft brush illuminates everything in its path fluorescent green — and it's fun to see! (Kristin Granero/Yahoo Life) (Dyson) Runtime: According to my research, the average cordless stick vacuum runtime hovers around 30 to 40 minutes for a budget-friendly model, 40 to 50 minutes for mid-priced and 50 minutes or above for luxury, with the Dyson Gen5detect topping my list at 70 minutes. I suggest at least 40 to 50 minutes for multi-floor jobs, and thorough cleanings incorporating ""max"" modes and attachments. Most of the cordless stick vacuum cleaners I tried require four(ish) hours of charging to reach full battery potential. Filter type: A lot of cordless stick vacuums available today are equipped with a filter for zapping pollutants and improving air quality, with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters considered the gold standard. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), HEPA filters ""theoretically remove at least 99.97% of dust, pollen, mold, bacteria and any airborne particles with a size of 0.3 microns,"" with larger or smaller particles “trapped with even higher efficiency.” Follow instruction manuals for how and when to replace filters for optimal results (many, like Dyson, now use washable filters for cost efficiency). Wattage: A higher wattage often correlates to greater suction power. High-voltage batteries generally have a longer shelf life, or runtime, so you can tackle more space or several vacuum jobs in one go without recharging. Brushes and attachments: Most of the cordless stick vacuums I tested come with a detangling brush roller that can be used for multiple floor types including carpets, some with an additional soft brush roller for hard surfaces. Brush cleaner headlights offer more visibility in low lighting and beneath furniture, while mini roller attachments help tackle tighter spaces (such as inside your car; they’re also great for getting stubborn pet fur from couch interiors). Brush tools aid in detailing and spot-treating (cushions, curtains), whereas crevice tools are a must for navigating ceilings and wall corners. Docking and storing: With freestanding docks, you don't have to screw a wall mount into place to keep your stick vacuum upright. Alternatively, all of the vacuum head ""uppers"" on this list can be charged separately via plug. You just have to then reattach them to the vacuum tube and cleaner head base when finished. No mount, no problem: The Tineco Pure One S15 comes with a freestanding, preassembled dock. The Shark Stratos tucks down and relies on its cleaner head as a base, for mobile stationing. (Kristin Granero/Yahoo Life) Advertisement Advertisement How we tested cordless stick vacuums I set up several obstacle courses to test these cordless stick vacuums against materials with varying shapes, textures and depths on different surfaces (carpet and hardwood) and their respective attachments on sofa and other upholsteries. Additionally, I put them through their paces in real-life scenarios, prioritizing homes that needed a good cleaning and/or had pet inhabitants. The nitty gritty: ""Carpet course"" test: I spaced out materials — faux fur, rice, Cheerios, kitty litter and sand — across a plush carpet to see how the vacuums managed to cut through the clutter. ""Kitchen sink"" test: I poured rice and Cheerios on a hardwood kitchen floor to gauge how well the vacuums could get a grip — especially against trims and in cabinet crevices. ""Passenger pet"" test: I asked family and friends to avoid vacuuming for a week, then used car mats to collect the fur their pet companions had shed, to see which vacuums had the best suction. ""Vacs gone wild"" test: I didn’t stop there! I clocked over 30 hours testing these vacuums in different houses and settings to see if they could rise to different occasions. Risky business: I sucked up faux fur, rice, kitty litter, Cheerios and sand on a plush carpet for one of my ""Carpet Course"" tests. (Kristin Granero/Yahoo Life) Other cordless stick vacuums we tested Dyson V8 Cordless Stick Vacuum: This is among Dyson's more compact and budget-conscious Dyson models and a touch taller and longer than the V7 with a slightly wider brush head and a bit more pickup. The vacuum maneuvers effortlessly over and around rugs and hardwood floors, and the hair screw tool worked miracles when it came to tight corners and detailing pet-loved couch interiors. The carpet suction isn't on the level of what I found with Dyson’s adjustable brush cleaner head (more below). Because of this, combined with the smaller dust cup (0.4 liters) and shorter runtime (40 minutes; I clocked 25 minutes when toggling between the higher power mode), I suggest it for smaller spaces with hardwood floors or shallow carpets and quicker jobs. Of note, the V8 doesn't have a digital display with battery life readings, so you don't know when it’s going to stop. Dyson V11 Cordless Stick Vacuum: With this vac, you get the same roller brush, attachments and operation style as the V8 but with a tad taller and heavier yet still incredibly nimble frame (yay, upgrades!). For around a $90 price increase (before sales), you get extended runtime (60 minutes total) and a bigger cup size, ideal for tackling multiple rooms (I also found the cup release lever, located on the underbelly of the bin, more effective at ridding waste than the V8). Plus, you get an LCD interface displaying power modes — in this case, three — along with battery life readings for keeping track of your juice. Dyson Outsize Cordless Stick Vacuum: Essentially a jumbo-sized Dyson (hence the name), this vac is the tallest and has the longest, widest brush roller, plus the largest cup capacity, of the Dyson vacuums I tried. It functions similarly to the Dyson V11 (there’s an LCD screen, three modes and a 60-minute runtime; the attachments are the same), but the Outsize has an adjustable cleaner head that allows you to toggle between three settings. The ""-"" optimizes performance for hardwood floors and the ""+"" offers better traction on carpets, a difference that really stood out in my ""kitchen sink"" and ""carpet course"" tests. It's a worthy splurge for bigger homes and wide, open spaces such as basements. Advertisement Advertisement Dyson V15 Detect: This Dyson is slightly heavier and pricier than the Dyson V12 Detect Slim, equipped with the same attachments, runtime, LCD screen and neon-emitting fluffy brush, which comes in handy when you want to do a deep cleaning. As mentioned above, it has a larger dust cup (0.8 liters), a bit more pickup (240 watts) and an adjustable anti-tangle roller brush that can be optimized for hardwood (""-"") or thick rug (""+"") surfaces, which appeared to make a difference in my traditional ""kitchen sink"" and ""passenger pet"" tests. The catch? As with most Dyson stick vacuums, you need to continuously press the V15 Detect's power switch to keep it going. Dyson's gen5Detect: You'll get the same bells and whistles as the Dyson V15 Detect — a detangling digital cleaner head and fluffy laser cleaner head, attachments and equal dust cup capacity — with slightly more power and a battery life of 70 minutes. The digital readouts are a nudge more sophisticated and — unique to all of the Dyson vacuums I tested except one — there’s a Start/Stop button versus a switch. It can be a little awkward to press the top button with one hand in the handle groove, and the vacuum is slightly top-heavy, but the button means you can relax your finger as you move. I would have given this best overall from a pure performance standpoint if I didn't consider price as a factor for the category. Sleek lineup: A selection of non-Dyson cordless stick vacuums prepare to go head-to-head in a range of tests to determine the best. (Kristin Granero/Yahoo Life) Tineco Pure One S15 Pet Smart Stick Vacuum (currently out of stock): This delivers one of the sleekest designs and smartest digital displays in its price range. Like many of the other vacuums on this list, it can be set up in a matter of seconds and comes with an equally minimalistic-looking, freestanding charging mount that requires no assembly. The LCD screen is similar to the Pure One S11, with Wi-Fi connectivity and a color-coded halo to distinguish the level of cleanliness, plus battery reads, and the brush cleaner head has ample light for visibility. As evident in our ""passenger pet"" test, the suction is a bit stronger than the Tineco Pure One S11 (just behind the Dyson and Shark vacuums I tested) and attachments include a mini anti-tangle brush for getting into grooves. Of note: there were a few instances where the S15 had trouble holding down its meals, spitting out finer particles such as rice from our ""kitchen sink"" test (should you want to vacuum up such things). Shark Rocket Pet Pro Cordless Stick Vacuum: It has some of the most powerful suction of the cordless stick vacuums I tried. In ""boost"" mode, comparable or just behind the Dyson Detects and Shark Stratos in our ""passenger pet"" test. In our ""kitchen sink"" test, regardless of the mode, it gobbled everything in its path — even down to finer Cheerio pieces and (most) rice particles in cabinet edges. Like the Stratos, it has a headlight for visibility and you can hinge the tube and brush cleaner head for controlled carrying; you don't need a wall mount to charge it standing. I like how the Samsung Stratos automatically adjusts its modes based on the job at hand (for the Rocket, you select between ""hardwood"" and ""carpet"" modes but have to hold the ""boost"" lever throughout) — and offers 20 additional minutes of run time. All things considered, the Rocket is still a solid choice for pet owners or anyone else who's looking for serious pickup on a smaller-than-Dyson dime. Note, however, this vacuum is currently out of stock.

https://www.hercampus.com/school/ucf/gen-z-elects-nepal-leader-on-discord-this-is-how-it-happened/,"With Nepal in Flames, Gen Z Elects The New Prime Minister On Discord","This article is written by a student writer from the Her Campus at UCF chapter and does not reflect the views of Her Campus.

On Sept. 4, Nepal enacted a social media ban, which included Facebook, Instagram, X, and YouTube. This ban triggered a nationwide protest, primarily composed of young people. Some demonstrations have turned violent, with reports over the last two weeks claiming around 72 people have died.

Termed the “Gen Z Protest” due to the majority of the rioters being younger demographics, the anger that fueled this revolution was more than a simple social media ban. It was a glimpse into Nepal’s long history of corruption and nepotism within its government. Many people viewed the social media ban as a means to censor the youth who spoke out against the government, with the youth of Nepal perceiving it as the final straw in the government’s efforts to limit their rights.

Transparency International assigned Nepal a Corruption Perceptions Index score of 34 out of 100. A score below 50 is considered extremely corrupt. Additionally, approximately 12% of public service users reported paying a bribe in the previous 12 months. When the people are unable to trust the government, it is the fall of a democratic republic, and it is a sign of the necessity of something new.

Just five days after the social media ban was enacted, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli resigned as a result of the people’s disturbed reaction to the killing of 19 protestors by police.

Following the protests, Nepal’s Military Chief, General Ashok Raj Sigdel, recorded a video asking protesters to stop burning buildings and help maintain peace. In parallel, the Nepal Army began patrolling the streets and started discussing the issue with protest leaders to find a solution.

As someone who is currently studying political science on the international policy track, the army’s response came as a red flag to me. I understand why the army was called in to settle unrest, but too often in history, this leads to a military authoritarian regime. Often, after a “revolution” or country-wide protests, we see the people thinking all they want is order, so they accept the military controlling the country for a small amount of time — but what happens when the military doesn’t want to give up their power? Historically, it appears that when this happens, another revolution is often necessary due to widespread unrest among the people under an authoritarian regime. Hopefully, this will not be Nepal’s fate, as things seem to finally be turning around for the better.

In choosing the next prime minister, Discord became Gen Z’s answer. On a channel hosted by Hami Nepal, one of the Gen Z groups behind the protests, a debate was held on the country’s future. This is where the next elected prime minister, former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki, comes into play.

Karki was sworn in as the new prime minister as of Sept. 12. Gen Z protestors view her as a revolutionary in their campaign against corruption. During her time as a justice, she jailed a government minister for corruption. She was Nepal’s first female chief justice and is now its first female prime minister. As a result of the protests, she has asked officials to rebuild the infrastructure that has been destroyed, as well as give money to the families of the protesters who have died.

In addition to electing Karki, Discord decided that there would be a new free election held on March 5, 2026, to decide the next prime minister. Although she doesn’t plan on being in power for longer than six months, Prime Minister Karki is seen as the leader who will crack down on government officials and create a new, prosperous Nepal.

With a new qualified leader, the biggest challenges she will face are to ensure the new free elections and to gain the military’s trust. As mentioned before, the army has the iron fist to either help Karki or to help the loyalists who might come against her. As of now, it appears that many countries are supporting this new era, so one can only hope that Nepali citizens will do the same.",https://www.hercampus.com/school/ucf/gen-z-elects-nepal-leader-on-discord-this-is-how-it-happened/,2025-09-25 10:00:00-04:00,"This article is written by a student writer from the Her Campus at UCF chapter and does not reflect the views of Her Campus. On Sept. 4, Nepal enacted a social media ban, which included Facebook, Instagram, X, and YouTube. This ban triggered a nationwide protest, primarily composed of young people. Some demonstrations have turned violent, with reports over the last two weeks claiming around 72 people have died. Termed the “Gen Z Protest” due to the majority of the rioters being younger demographics, the anger that fueled this revolution was more than a simple social media ban. It was a glimpse into Nepal’s long history of corruption and nepotism within its government. Many people viewed the social media ban as a means to censor the youth who spoke out against the government, with the youth of Nepal perceiving it as the final straw in the government’s efforts to limit their rights. Transparency International assigned Nepal a Corruption Perceptions Index score of 34 out of 100. A score below 50 is considered extremely corrupt. Additionally, approximately 12% of public service users reported paying a bribe in the previous 12 months. When the people are unable to trust the government, it is the fall of a democratic republic, and it is a sign of the necessity of something new. Just five days after the social media ban was enacted, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli resigned as a result of the people’s disturbed reaction to the killing of 19 protestors by police. Following the protests, Nepal’s Military Chief, General Ashok Raj Sigdel, recorded a video asking protesters to stop burning buildings and help maintain peace. In parallel, the Nepal Army began patrolling the streets and started discussing the issue with protest leaders to find a solution. As someone who is currently studying political science on the international policy track, the army’s response came as a red flag to me.

While a cozy sweater or a new accessory is always appreciated, the generation is increasingly prioritizing meaningful connections and shared experiences over just tangible goods. This shift reflects a broader trend among young adults who value intentionality, sustainability, and mental well-being—all things that can be fostered through a truly thoughtful gift from a loved one. Forget the frantic dash for the hottest new tech gadget; this year, Gen Z is asking their partners for gifts that say, “I see you, and I want to spend time with you.”

The desire for quality time as a gift is especially significant for many in this generation. In a world saturated with digital communication and busy schedules, dedicated, uninterrupted time with a partner feels like a true luxury. For many, the ultimate gift isn’t something wrapped up in a box, but a planned date, an adventurous trip, or simply a focused, cozy day together. This focus on connection is particularly evident in long-distance relationships, where physical gifts can’t replace the need for emotional presence. Whether you’re looking for the perfect present for a long-term SO, or trying to find a gift for a newer partner you deeply care about, understanding this preference for connection can help you nail the perfect holiday gift.

The wish list for Gen Z partners this holiday season is less about dollar signs and more about intentional thought and understanding one another’s needs. Here are the main things Gen Z hopes their partners consider this year.

Experiences That Become Memories For partners in long-term relationships, the move away from physical gifts is often driven by a desire to create new shared memories. Julianna, 25, who has been with her partner for 10 years, tells Her Campus, “At this point in our relationship, I value things like experiences and quality time over tangible gifts! Things like concert tickets or a weekend trip where we can spend time together are priceless to me, and always make the best gifts.” Similarly, Lily, a 23-year-old grad student at Emerson College, emphasizes the same sentiment for her first official Christmas with her partner. “One of our love languages is definitely quality time, so I would love anything experience-wise, whether it’s a cozy weekend getaway, a fun class we can take together, or even just a day planned around our favorite things.” These types of gifts show a deep understanding of the relationship’s dynamic and a commitment to nurturing it. The Priceless Gift Of Quality Time (Even Long Distance) For many college students, the holidays mean navigating a long-distance relationship. In this situation, the true gift isn’t what’s under the tree, but the effort put into bridging the gap. Olivia Armstead, 20, a student at Hampton University, highlights this reality. She says, “Since my boyfriend and I will be in separate states for the holidays, just planned virtual dates, letters and personalized notes, and simply quality time means the most to me. I’m not a person who’s really huge on receiving gifts, I really cherish quality time.” This underscores that intentional, focused time — even if it’s over video chat — is valued far more than a material item. Support For Hobbies & Self-Care Another key theme for Gen Z is a request for gifts that acknowledge their mental well-being and support their personal pursuits. As many navigate the stress of college or the beginning of their careers, gifts that encourage hobbies and self-care are seen as a thoughtful gesture. University of Windsor student Liv, 23, puts it simply: “This year I really hope that my boyfriend gets me something related to my hobbies. Since starting my master’s, and to not go off the deep end, I’ve been really focused on utilizing my hobbies to help with stress instead of doomscrolling.” Liv notes that a thoughtful gift could be anything from “new colouring books, a new game or accessory for my console, or even some cute workout clothes.” Even the desire for cozy items — a blanket, a matching set, or socks — falls into this category, representing comfort and a nudge toward relaxation during a busy time of year.

Ultimately, the best present a Gen Z partner can receive this holiday season isn’t found on a store shelf, but in the effort of their partner. Whether it’s a planned vacation, or a simple thoughtful note, these holiday gifts secure an emotional connection that will truly last long after the holiday season into the new year!",https://www.hercampus.com/wellness/gen-z-women-want-for-the-holidays-from-partners-experiences-quality-time/,2025-12-12 16:23:10-05:00,"This holiday season, Gen Z is switching up their wish lists.

That’s something Shelomi Sanders, a junior guard on the Alabama A&M basketball team, has felt her entire athletic career.

After starting her college career at the Jackson State, an HBCU in Mississippi, during the 2022-2023 season, Sanders then spent last year playing at the University of Colorado — where her dad, former NFL player Deion Sanders, coached football and her brothers, Shilo and Shedeur, also played football. In spring 2024, Sanders made the decision to transfer again; this time to play for Alabama A&M. For Sanders, transferring schools wasn’t just about basketball — it was about stepping into her own identity. “I just wanted to make a name for myself and just prove to everyone ‘Hey, I’m not just Shilo Sanders’s sister. I’m not just Deion Sanders’s daughter. I’m here, this is me,’” Sanders tells Her Campus.

What most people don’t see is the work it takes for Sanders to compete at the D1 level while managing a chronic autoimmune disease — and that’s part of what makes her journey as an athlete unique.

Sanders was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at 13, a moment she remembers as “very scary” for her young teen self. “My whole life [was] changing,” Sanders says. “I had to learn how to be responsible very young.” Now as a college athlete, managing the condition on top of a full D1 schedule takes a level of planning most people never think about. “It’s always just a roller coaster,” Sanders says. “You’re learning things about your body every single day.”

Her mornings start before most students are even awake. “We have weights or practice [at] 6:30 [a.m.], and we have to be there, dressed, 15 minutes early,” Sanders says. From there, Sanders will watch footage of her games, go to class, put in extra work on the court outside of practice, and attend mandatory study hall. “I probably don’t get home until like 6 or 7 [at night] depending on what the day brings.”

Even on her best days, T1D can completely shift how things go. “My blood [sugar] will drop during practice, [then] I have to sit out,” she says. And while she tries to stay positive, it still gets to her. “I’m just in a mood because I want to join in with my teammates and practice, but I can’t. I have to put my health first.” The balance is tough, but she keeps pushing. “It’s a lot mentally and physically,” Sanders says. “But, you know, it’s worth it all.”

Talking more openly about her diagnosis has made Sanders aware of how many misconceptions people still have about it. She says she still hears people assume that eating too much sugar causes T1D. “That’s not really what it is,” Sanders says. For Sanders, clearing up these myths matters, because they distract from what living with T1D actually looks like. Especially with the CDC projecting a 65% rise in T1D among young people by 2060, Sanders believes her voice matters more than ever.

This is why Sanders decided to partner with Sanofi Screen For Type 1, a movement that works to raise awareness about early detection of T1D and encourage people to talk to their doctors about the importance of type 1 diabetes screening. “When I shared my story and I found that there’s other peers like me that are battling T1D, I found a community and it was really cool,” Sanders says. She wants young people to have access to information earlier than she did. “If I had the resources and the awareness when I got diagnosed, my journey would be different,” she says.

When Sanders thinks about young people going through their own health journeys, her message is simple: Don’t count yourself out. “You’re unstoppable,” Sanders says. “Don’t let anything hold you back.”",https://www.hercampus.com/wellness/shelomi-sanders-basketball-t1-diabetes-interview/,2025-11-24 13:28:46-05:00,"When you grow up in a family full of athletes, it’s easy for outsiders to assume your path is set.

With the release of her 12th studio album, The Life of a Showgirl, her engagement announcement in August, and now the release of her Eras Tour docuseries on Disney Plus, The End of an Era, it’s been all Taylor all the time. Swift’s docuseries serves as a love letter to the fans, revealing behind-the-scenes moments from The Eras Tour and revealing some snippets from her life (that fans haven’t had since her 2020 Netflix documentary film, Miss Americana). One of those snippets was a phone call she had with her fiancé, Travis Kelce.

A highlight of the series is getting a glimpse into Swift’s private life — something Swifties don’t often see. In the first episode of her docuseries, Swift has an adorable conversation between her and her now-fiancé, Travis Kelce. While the conversation was initially teased in the trailer for the series, fans are finally able to hear the entire thing, and the entire internet is swooning.

The phone call took place before one of Swift’s London Eras Tour shows in August 2024, with the couple talking excitedly about the show. Speaking about her rehearsal for Ed Sheeran’s surprise appearance, Kelce asks Swift, “Are you guys so good that you can just do, like, a quick in-the-back-room-rehearsal and then go and do this live in front of everyone?”

“I love you,” Swift laughed. “I don’t know, how do you remember 36,000 plays that are all tactical missions and then just go do it? It’s the same. It’s basically the same job. I got songs to remember, you got plays to remember… you’ve got Coach Reid, I’ve got my mom,” says Swift.

Kelce shouts, “I want to be there!” to which Swift responds, “I want you to be here. Why do you have to be in the NFL?” Kelce can later be heard ending their call. “I love you so much baby, thank you for making my day better,” he said. “I love you so much,” Swift replied. “Some people get a vitamin drip, I got this conversation.”

Of course, after hearing this conversation, fans’ hearts are exploding. Many have shared their reactions on X and they are beyond relatable.

Content warning: This story is about gun violence.

Like many others in my generation — sometimes referred to as the “lockdown generation” — the risk of gun violence in schools has been a constant. My K-12 experience was filled with emergency drills, run-hide-fight trainings, and headlines reminding me that students just like me went to school only to never come home again. During my time in college alone, I have seen the effects of shootings at Florida State University and Michigan State University; I’ve mourned their losses and I’ve been reminded that I need to prepare in case my campus is next.

On Dec. 13, Brown University was the latest school to experience a shooting, which, according to multiple reports, took the lives of two students and injured at least nine others. As an education major, this tragic news brings up the same feelings of fear and grief that all of these stories do, and reinforces a disturbing truth about my chosen field of study and future profession: Not only am I currently facing down the everyday possibility of a campus shooting as a college student, but I am also preparing for a career in which that will be an ongoing threat. It’s a devastating reality I know many of my fellow education majors grapple with — not just in the days following the news of the latest school shooting, but every day of our lives.

As a future teacher, I know this constant worry won’t end once I graduate college.

My whole life, I have been told that college is supposed to be my best years — and the best time to take risks. But how can I do so, when this time in my life has been spent doing whatever I can to stay safe? My classmates and I take actions every day that come from a place of fear of violence in our learning environment. I try to sit in view of exits in my classes; I make sure to stay hyper-vigilant in crowded spaces. I often wonder whether these habits will help me do the right thing in the face of violence.

As a future teacher, I know this constant worry won’t end once I graduate college. Doing the right thing during an active shooter situation becomes infinitely more important when the lives of students depend on the actions I take as an educator. This is something I have to prepare myself for — there are no classes in my teacher education curriculum that tells me how to respond to those calling for schools to arm teachers, or how to wrap my head around how acting in loco parentis (in place of parents) comes with the expectation of risking your own life for your students’ safety. Gun violence in this country become so normalized that educating and protecting my students may mean making the ultimate sacrifice — and receiving only thoughts and prayers in return. That’s what I’m signing up for.

Nevertheless, I wouldn’t trade my career path in teaching for anything. So far, I have loved my time in the classroom and with the students I have taught. Making a positive impact on those in my care will always be my motivation, no matter the risk. Despite the near-constant headlines, I choose to hold out hope that, one day, no educator will have to fear for their lives and the lives of their students. I have seen others send prayers without speaking up, but being an education major has only solidified my belief that, when it comes to gun violence, enough is enough. The students in my future classroom deserve to believe that there is more to life than living in fear — and so do I.",https://www.hercampus.com/career/education-major-school-shootings-op-ed/,2025-12-15 16:33:59-05:00,"The opinions expressed in this article are the writer’s own and do not reflect the views of Her Campus.

(Oof, I feel a knife to the heart just writing it.) While breakups that come as a result of constant fighting and disagreements sting, what about those splits that end amicably? You know, the ones where the only thing that went wrong was the timing?

Maybe it was the result of sudden career growth, or the realization that you can’t commit enough time to a relationship no matter how hard you try. Regardless of the reasoning, these breakups can hurt even more than the ones that come with bad blood — and they’re more common than you’d think. Recently, social media star Alix Earle opened up about her breakup with NFL player Braxton Berrios on TikTok, citing their respective growth and commitments as the reason for ending their two-year relationship.

Navigating a breakup that’s a result of a “right person, wrong time” situation is tough, and it may require a different approach. (Because if your ex was actually super great, there’s really no reason to scream-cry to songs about hating them, right?) So, I spoke to DatingAdvice.com‘s resident AASECT-certified sexologist Natassia Miller about how you can heal from a breakup that happened with the right person at the wrong time, no scream-crying needed.

Why do the “right person, wrong time” breakups hurt more?

In simpler terms, Miller says that the “‘right person, wrong time’ is the heartbreak that hits when the love is real, but the reality of your lives just doesn’t line up.” She adds, “Think long distance, totally different cities or career paths, clashing priorities, or one person being in a massive growth era while the other needs stability.”

And, naturally, this kind of breakup has a tendency to hurt that much more. “It feels unfair precisely because nothing ‘bad’ happened,” Miller says. “No cheating, no betrayal — just the slow realization that love alone is not enough to make a relationship sustainable.”

However, Staying In That Relationship Can Hurt You More.

So, if nothing is technically “wrong” in terms of attraction and, well, love, then why even break up in the first place? “Research on breakups in emerging adults shows that clinging to a relationship you can’t fully be in — especially if you can’t accept that it’s over — predicts more depression and anxiety and keeps you stuck in distress longer,” Miller says. “Staying just because you’re in love can quietly turn that love into resentment when your needs constantly go unmet. When timing is off, one or both people end up chronically under-nourished, feeling lonely and anxious. Over time, that can tank self-esteem and mental health in ways that are just as painful as a betrayal.”

And while breaking things off can be hard, it’s actually the best thing you can do for your relationship and yourself. “Ending it, even while you still care, is a way of saying, ‘Both of us deserve a relationship that actually fits our lives right now,’ and that’s an act of care, not failure,” Miller adds.

So, How Do You HeaL from a “right person, wrong Time” breakup?

I get it. Ending a relationship you thought would last is nothing short of brutal — especially emotionally. “Healing from a ‘right person, wrong time’ breakup hurts in a very specific way because you’re not just grieving what you had — you’re grieving the future story you thought you were writing together,” Miller says. “That’s why your brain keeps replaying memories and spinning ‘what if’ scenarios.”

Moving forward can feel impossible, but in time (and with healthy coping mechanisms), you’ll be able to make it through. But first, you’re going to need to take the breakup seriously — meaning it might be best to cut ties. “Let yourself actually grieve, and don’t just stay friends,” Miller says. “Studies suggest that people with a hard time accepting a breakup stay sadder for longer — trying to keep them close too soon can feed that non-acceptance. A period of low or no contact, at least 30–60 days, gives your nervous system space to recalibrate.”

Additionally, take this as a time to reflect inward, and on the relationship. “Shift from ‘what if’ to ‘what is,'” Miller says. “Journaling about why the relationship didn’t work in this season (distance, emotional bandwidth, conflicting goals) helps your brain update the story from ‘we were perfect’ to ‘we were real and also limited,’ which is key for healing.”

Finally, try not to place blame on any party (well, except for the universe) when thinking about the breakup. “Use healthy coping, not self-punishment,” Miller says. “Longitudinal research on young adults shows that coping by blaming or punishing yourself (replaying your ‘mistakes’ nonstop) is linked to worse depression and anxiety after a breakup, while coping that includes acceptance, reframing, and optimism helps you recover better.” Think of tools like therapy, talking it out with friends and family, and slowly building a life that excites you again through hobbies and other ways to pass the time.

Is there Any Way To Reconnect?

Miller’s advice? It’s something I want tattooed on me: “You do not automatically owe the relationship a sequel just because you loved each other once.”

She adds, “The real question is not if you still care, but rather has anything changed? If distance, mental health, or life chaos are still the same, you’re not in a new chapter. You’re in a rerun.”

Before trying again, when things are boding better for both of you, Miller recommends taking a step back to think. “Are you both emotionally available and willing to do things differently? If you reconnect without new skills — better communication, clearer boundaries, more honest conversations — you’re likely to recreate the same breakup,” she says.

Additionally, Miller says to ask yourself if getting back together supports the life you’re building, not derails it. “If reconnecting would pull you away from your own growth, friendships, or goals that matter deeply, timing may still be off, even if the love is still there,” Miller says.

And, if things do work out? “If you do choose to reconnect, treating it like a new relationship — not a continuation —can be grounding,” Miller says. “Talk explicitly about what was hard last time, what’s different now, and what you both need going forward. If those conversations feel impossible, that in itself is an answer.”",https://www.hercampus.com/wellness/how-to-heal-from-right-person-wrong-time-breakup-expert/,2025-12-15 15:59:55-05:00,"The only thing that hurts worse in a breakup than “It’s not you, it’s me” is hearing someone say that you were the right person at the wrong time.

Navigating a breakup that’s a result of a “right person, wrong time” situation is tough, and it may require a different approach. (Because if your ex was actually super great, there’s really no reason to scream-cry to songs about hating them, right?) So, I spoke to DatingAdvice.com‘s resident AASECT-certified sexologist Natassia Miller about how you can heal from a breakup that happened with the right person at the wrong time, no scream-crying needed. Why do the “right person, wrong time” breakups hurt more? In simpler terms, Miller says that the “‘right person, wrong time’ is the heartbreak that hits when the love is real, but the reality of your lives just doesn’t line up.” She adds, “Think long distance, totally different cities or career paths, clashing priorities, or one person being in a massive growth era while the other needs stability.” And, naturally, this kind of breakup has a tendency to hurt that much more. “It feels unfair precisely because nothing ‘bad’ happened,” Miller says. “No cheating, no betrayal — just the slow realization that love alone is not enough to make a relationship sustainable.” However, Staying In That Relationship Can Hurt You More. So, if nothing is technically “wrong” in terms of attraction and, well, love, then why even break up in the first place? “Research on breakups in emerging adults shows that clinging to a relationship you can’t fully be in — especially if you can’t accept that it’s over — predicts more depression and anxiety and keeps you stuck in distress longer,” Miller says. “Staying just because you’re in love can quietly turn that love into resentment when your needs constantly go unmet. When timing is off, one or both people end up chronically under-nourished, feeling lonely and anxious. Over time, that can tank self-esteem and mental health in ways that are just as painful as a betrayal.” And while breaking things off can be hard, it’s actually the best thing you can do for your relationship and yourself. “Ending it, even while you still care, is a way of saying, ‘Both of us deserve a relationship that actually fits our lives right now,’ and that’s an act of care, not failure,” Miller adds. So, How Do You HeaL from a “right person, wrong Time” breakup? I get it. Ending a relationship you thought would last is nothing short of brutal — especially emotionally. “Healing from a ‘right person, wrong time’ breakup hurts in a very specific way because you’re not just grieving what you had — you’re grieving the future story you thought you were writing together,” Miller says. “That’s why your brain keeps replaying memories and spinning ‘what if’ scenarios.” Moving forward can feel impossible, but in time (and with healthy coping mechanisms), you’ll be able to make it through. But first, you’re going to need to take the breakup seriously — meaning it might be best to cut ties. “Let yourself actually grieve, and don’t just stay friends,” Miller says. “Studies suggest that people with a hard time accepting a breakup stay sadder for longer — trying to keep them close too soon can feed that non-acceptance. A period of low or no contact, at least 30–60 days, gives your nervous system space to recalibrate.” Additionally, take this as a time to reflect inward, and on the relationship. “Shift from ‘what if’ to ‘what is,'” Miller says. “Journaling about why the relationship didn’t work in this season (distance, emotional bandwidth, conflicting goals) helps your brain update the story from ‘we were perfect’ to ‘we were real and also limited,’ which is key for healing.” Finally, try not to place blame on any party (well, except for the universe) when thinking about the breakup. “Use healthy coping, not self-punishment,” Miller says. “Longitudinal research on young adults shows that coping by blaming or punishing yourself (replaying your ‘mistakes’ nonstop) is linked to worse depression and anxiety after a breakup, while coping that includes acceptance, reframing, and optimism helps you recover better.” Think of tools like therapy, talking it out with friends and family, and slowly building a life that excites you again through hobbies and other ways to pass the time. Is there Any Way To Reconnect? Miller’s advice? It’s something I want tattooed on me: “You do not automatically owe the relationship a sequel just because you loved each other once.” She adds, “The real question is not if you still care, but rather has anything changed? If distance, mental health, or life chaos are still the same, you’re not in a new chapter. You’re in a rerun.” Before trying again, when things are boding better for both of you, Miller recommends taking a step back to think. “Are you both emotionally available and willing to do things differently? If you reconnect without new skills — better communication, clearer boundaries, more honest conversations — you’re likely to recreate the same breakup,” she says. Additionally, Miller says to ask yourself if getting back together supports the life you’re building, not derails it. “If reconnecting would pull you away from your own growth, friendships, or goals that matter deeply, timing may still be off, even if the love is still there,” Miller says. And, if things do work out? “If you do choose to reconnect, treating it like a new relationship — not a continuation —can be grounding,” Miller says. “Talk explicitly about what was hard last time, what’s different now, and what you both need going forward. If those conversations feel impossible, that in itself is an answer.”",0.0589666829586184,0.5499899629939949,neutral,"{'neg': 0.129, 'neu': 0.728, 'pos': 0.143, 'compound': 0.9841}",positive

On the afternoon of Dec. 13, a school shooting rocked yet another college campus. This time, it was Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. As of Dec. 15, there have been two confirmed deaths and nine other reported injuries, with officials still searching for a suspect. Since the shooting, over 2,000 students have been relocated to safe locations, and all remaining final exams have been canceled.

For Brown students, a day that was meant for studying, completing exams, and getting excited about their winter break became a day that changed their lives forever. In the aftermath, many students are left reeling from the tragedy and attempting to regain some sense of normalcy. And with campus shootings unfortunately being a quintessential part of growing up Gen Z, some students are coping with what happened in a very Gen Z way: sharing their experiences on TikTok.

For some students, their first reaction was disbelief. “I didn’t believe it was a real shooting,” a student named Zana, who had been in the area on campus at the time of the shooting, said in a video. “It just didn’t set in. I realized how narrowly I had missed that, and how lucky I am.”

Many students on TikTok are highlighting just how close they came to the attack. “To think the only reason I can post this is because I left the library 5 minutes early to get coffee since I was so stressed from finals and now none of that matters,” one student named Anya shared. Another student, named Grace, posted a video of her desk pushed up against the door of her dorm room. “To think the only reason I’m safely barricaded in my dorm is because my sweatpants were dirty and I didn’t want to walk in the cold without them,” the video’s text read.

For many students, this situation is something they have, sadly, been at least somewhat prepared for. According to CNN, there have been at least 75 school shootings in the U.S. in 2025 alone, with 43 of them taking place on college campuses. Per the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit providing free public access to information about gun-related violence nationwide, there have been 392 mass shootings this year, more than there have been days in the year. One student expressed his frustration and anger over this reality in a TikTok video. “Today I had to make the phone call to my parents and send that text message in which I say I love them… and [say] I won’t see them again,” creator @jjkuoo said. “That’s not normal.”

For many students, the shooting will forever change their college experience. “I used to study at those places a lot,” Heela, a college content creator, said in her video, referring to the part of campus where the shooting took place. “I don’t think I want to step foot in there again.”

William, a senior and TA at Brown, spoke out in a video serving as a message to other students, urging them to let themselves feel scared following this tragedy. “I teach review sessions in that classroom all the time,” William said. “Let yourself feel scared … [and] don’t stop thinking about those most affected.”

Brown held a vigil held on the evening of Dec. 14, which hundreds of students, faculty, and community members attended to mourn the victims and their families, and to show support for the Brown community. The mayor of Providence, Brett Smiley, spoke at the vigil, saying he hoped it would be the “first little flicker for our community to get together and heal.”",https://www.hercampus.com/culture/brown-students-dec-13-shooting-tiktok/,2025-12-15 13:33:42-05:00,"Content warning: This story is about gun violence.

Viewers have been waiting anxiously for the second part of the season after the first set of episodes dropped on Nov. 26 — especially following the cliffhanger of Season 5, Episode 4. Now, fans are finally getting a look at the next three episodes of Stranger Things with the Season 5 Volume 2 trailer.

The trailer picks up where Episode 4 — “Sorcerer” — left off, with Will on the ground after killing the demogorgons. “We failed. We never stood a chance,” he says in the voiceover. “This is not over,” Joyce tells him. “Not by a long shot.” We then see Max and Holly Wheeler trying to escape Vecna’s dreams. Later on in the trailer, we see Dustin saying, “This whole time, everything we ever thought about the Upside Down has been dead wrong.” During the entire trailer, Diana Ross’s “Upside Down” plays in the background.

This isn’t the first trailer that Stranger Things has released. Back in October, the full official trailer for Season 5 was released. Before that, in July, Netflix shared a full-length teaser. In the video, Steve was seen parked in a van outside 94.5 The SQUAWK, a radio station in Hawkins. Steve turns a wheel on the van’s roof to turn the decibel level higher and higher throughout the trailer. Viewers then see the kids of Stranger Things leaving the radio station parking lot on their bikes, and hear Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) say, “Burn commencing in 5, 4, 3, 2, and…” We then hear Jonathan Byers (Charlie Heaton) saying, “After what we’ve been through, this thing, it ties us together. Forever.”

As Dustin and Jonathan speak, clips from the new season flash on the screen, including flocks of soldiers standing watch at a gate to the Upside Down, Dustin visiting Eddie’s grave site, and Lucas sitting with Max in the hospital, where she is still unconscious. We also see Hopper tell Eleven, “Let’s end this, kid.” When the trailer hits 100 decibels, the screen goes black. Vecna is then heard, saying, “Found you.”

Back in November 2024, Netflix revealed all eight episode titles for the upcoming season in a teaser video. The fifth and final season began with “The Crawl,” followed by “The Vanishing Of _____.” (The teaser blurred out the name, so it was unclear which character’s disappearance rocked Season 5. We now know that to be Holly Wheeler.) Episode 3 was titled “The Turnbow Trap,” while Episodes 4 and 5 are titled “Sorcerer” and “Shock Jock,” respectively. Episode 6 is titled “Escape from Camazotz,” Episode 7 is called “The Bridge,” and the series finale is titled “The Rightside Up,” which could hint at the end of The Upside Down.

The teaser also revealed that the fifth season is set in November 1987, which is a bit of a time jump from Season 4, which was set in March 1986. Maya Hawke, who portrays Robin Buckley, appeared on the Podcrushed podcast back in June 2024, where she shared that the eight episodes of the final season will feel like “eight movies,” highlighting the long length of the episodes.

The Season 5 trailer has fans theorizing what’s to come.

On July 15, 2024, a video of the Stranger Things BTS was posted on social media. The video shows clips of set-building, characters on set, actors in their trailers, and some commentary from the cast. Millie Bobby Brown reflected on how long she’s been playing the role of Eleven, saying, “I started when I was 10, I’m now turning 20 years old. Feels very weird.”

Other cast members also expressed excitement for the upcoming season. “We’re just kind of savoring every single moment,” Sadie Sink, who portrays Max, said. “It’s just so exciting. I think this is going to be the best season yet,” Noah Schnapp (Will Byers) expressed. If the cast is this excited about Season 5, we should be, too.

The clips fans have seen from Season 5 so far have fans theorizing about what’s to come in the final season of the show. Some think we’ll get even more information about Will’s previous experience in the Upside Down and how it connects to the end of the show, while others are theorizing which member(s) of the Hawkins crew may not make it out of the final battle.

Now, all we have to do is wait patiently until Dec. 25 for the next three episodes of Stranger Things, though I don’t doubt the wait will be worth it (and only hope that Vecna is finally defeated once and for all).",https://www.hercampus.com/culture/stranger-things-season-5-teaser-trailer-release-date/,2025-12-15 10:31:12-05:00,"It’s only a matter of days until fans head back to the town of Hawkins and the world of the Upside Down for Season 5 Volume 2 of Stranger Things.

https://www.cryptopolitan.com/nepal-elects-interim-pm-via-discord-vote/,Nepal Gen Zs endorse interim prime minister via Discord vote,"Nepal’s ongoing political power has directed thousands of Gen Z activists to Discord, a gaming chat platform, to endorse former chief justice Sushila Karki as interim prime minister.

After Nepal’s prime minister abruptly resigned on Tuesday, which collapsed the nation’s government, the military imposed a curfew across Kathmandu, restricted public gatherings, and assumed control of the streets.

Young activists have now turned to Discord after the country’s leadership issued an eviction notice to Meta in a social media crackdown about a week ago, as covered by Cryptopolitan.

“The Parliament of Nepal right now is Discord,” said Sid Ghimiri, a 23-year-old content creator in Kathmandu. He said national television stations have been broadcasting excerpts from chatrooms, while Nepali news sites are live-streaming sessions from the server.

Gen Z tells military to appoint Karki through Discord

The Discord server was launched by Hami Nepal, a civic organization active during the week’s anti-corruption protests. In four days, the server grew to more than 145,000 members, most of them young Nepalis.

“The point was to simulate a kind of mini-election,” explained Shaswot Lamichhane, a recent high school graduate and one of the moderators. He said the initiative was not intended to represent the entire country but to suggest an interim leader who could oversee elections.

More than half of Nepal’s population of 30 million is now connected to the internet, according to World Bank data. That connectivity fueled protests of Gen Z citizens angered about corruption and a social media ban of 26 platforms including Facebook and YouTube, culminating in the resignation of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli.

Many Nepalis rushed to download VPN services to evade government restrictions spearheaded largely by young demonstrators, many in their 20s, who flooded the streets of Kathmandu last Monday. Their demand was for the government to restore access to banned social media platforms and hold leaders accountable.

Downloads of Proton VPN surged 6,000% in three days, according to the Swiss-based company. Fears of an internet shutdown also drove a spike in use of Bitchat, a Bluetooth-based messaging app created by billionaire tech entrepreneur Jack Dorsey.

Members debated several potential candidates, including influencer Rastra Bimochan Timilsina, young politician Sagar Dhakal, Dharan mayor Harka Sampang, and social entrepreneur Mahabir Pun. A Discord server with over 145,000 members had a heated debate over Nepal’s interim leadership, but many rallied behind 73-year-old former chief justice Karki.

According to the South China Morning Post, Army chiefs met with Discord organizers earlier this week, asking them to propose a nominee for interim prime minister. A manifesto drafted by Gen Z activists with contributions from other citizens was released through social media for public feedback on the same day, compiled in 36 hours.

Nepal’s constitution has an emergency clause to be used in times of crisis to appoint an interim leader. But the process is largely opaque, so it is unclear if the army will formally endorse the Discord-backed choice.

Some Gen Z citizens feel the vote was flawed

The Discord server had more than 40,000 active members, but only 7,713 votes were recorded before moderators closed the polls after Karki crossed the 50% threshold. Some participants asked if the process had enough moderators and votes to uphold the essence of democracy, impartiality.

“With her affiliation to political leaders, how do we know she will remain independent?” asked one Gen Z member who participated in the chat. He proposed that Karki should take a public oath to guarantee her neutrality.

“We do not have definite leaders to represent us,” said Samdip Yadav, a 23-year-old graduate in Kathmandu. “At times it felt like a random social media call. It happened so quickly. But the discussions showed that young people want their voices heard, even if the format was disorganized.”

https://www.cryptopolitan.com/nepal-elects-interim-pm-via-discord-vote/,Gadgets prices go higher as AI chip demand strains global supply,"According to analysts, your next phone or laptop may cost more than expected. The massive push to build artificial intelligence data centers is creating serious bottlenecks across electronics supply chains, and that’s bad news for gadget prices.

Companies are throwing hundreds of billions at AI infrastructure worldwide, per reports. The problem? Those data center chips come from the same suppliers making parts for your phone and laptop. Component prices are jumping, and there are real worries about shortages and higher costs down the line.

Peter Hanbury, a partner at Bain & Company’s technology practice, put it simply: “We see the rapid increase in demand for AI in data centers driving bottlenecks in many areas.”

Multiple Pressure Points

Eddie Wu, the CEO of Alibaba, gave one of the starkest warnings yet. His company builds AI systems and makes custom chips, which means he’s got a front-row seat to these supply problems. Wu flagged shortages hitting semiconductor producers, memory chips, and data storage equipment.

“There is a situation of undersupply,” Wu said. He called it “a relatively large bottleneck” that could stick around for two to three years.

Hard disk drives have become a major chokepoint. Production is maxed out, so companies like Microsoft and Google switched to solid-state drives instead. Here’s where it gets tricky. Those solid-state drives are the same ones that go into phones and laptops.

Then there’s memory chips. Counterpoint Research expects memory prices to jump 30% in the fourth quarter of this year, then climb another 20% in early 2026.

MS Hwang, research director at Counterpoint Research, says even small supply-demand gaps can cause big price swings. “Imbalances of 1-2% can trigger sharp price increases and we’re seeing that figure hitting 3% levels at the moment – this is very significant,” Hwang said.

Building more capacity takes massive investment. Suppliers got worried that market projections were too rosy, so they held back on expanding their pricey facilities.

“Now, the suppliers need to add capacity quickly but as we know, it takes 2-3 years to add semiconductor manufacturing fabs” Hanbury explained.

Nvidia’s “Seismic” Change

Nvidia runs the AI chip market, and a recent product change has made things worse for consumer electronics suppliers. The company’s increasingly using Low-Power Double Data Rate memory because it’s more power efficient.

The thing is, Samsung and Apple use that same memory technology. Supply chains used to handle demand from just a handful of big electronics makers. Now Nvidia’s in the mix too, competing for identical components.

“We also see a bigger risk on the horizon is with advanced memory as Nvidia’s recent pivot to LPDDR means they’re a customer on the scale of a major smartphone maker — a seismic shift for the supply chain which can’t easily absorb this scale of demand,” Hwang said.

Memory chips and storage make up roughly 10% to 25% of what it costs to build a typical computer or smartphone. If component prices jump 20% to 30%, the total materials cost goes up by 5% to 10%.

“In terms of timing, the impact will likely start shortly as component costs are already increasing and likely accelerate into next year,” Hanbury said.

Electronics companies are raising red flags. Xiaomi, the world’s third-largest smartphone seller, told Reuters this month that buyers should brace for “a sizeable rise in product retail prices.”

Jeff Clark, Dell’s chief operating officer, called the increases “unprecedented.” “We have not seen costs move at the rate that we’ve seen,” he said.

Beyond pricier gadgets, there’s a real chance of shortages. “Beyond the rise in cost there’s a second issue and that’s the inability to secure enough components, which constrains the production of electronic devices,” Hwang said.

It’s not just consumer electronics either. Cars, industrial equipment, aerospace, and defense all rely on the same manufacturing capabilities that are now focused on AI customers. They’ll “likely see some impact from these price increases as well,” Hanbury said.

The massive push to build artificial intelligence data centers is creating serious bottlenecks across electronics supply chains, and that’s bad news for gadget prices. Companies are throwing hundreds of billions at AI infrastructure worldwide, per reports. The problem? Those data center chips come from the same suppliers making parts for your phone and laptop. Component prices are jumping, and there are real worries about shortages and higher costs down the line. Peter Hanbury, a partner at Bain & Company’s technology practice, put it simply: “We see the rapid increase in demand for AI in data centers driving bottlenecks in many areas.” Multiple Pressure Points Eddie Wu, the CEO of Alibaba, gave one of the starkest warnings yet. His company builds AI systems and makes custom chips, which means he’s got a front-row seat to these supply problems. Wu flagged shortages hitting semiconductor producers, memory chips, and data storage equipment. “There is a situation of undersupply,” Wu said. He called it “a relatively large bottleneck” that could stick around for two to three years. Hard disk drives have become a major chokepoint. Production is maxed out, so companies like Microsoft and Google switched to solid-state drives instead. Here’s where it gets tricky. Those solid-state drives are the same ones that go into phones and laptops. Then there’s memory chips. Counterpoint Research expects memory prices to jump 30% in the fourth quarter of this year, then climb another 20% in early 2026. MS Hwang, research director at Counterpoint Research, says even small supply-demand gaps can cause big price swings. “Imbalances of 1-2% can trigger sharp price increases and we’re seeing that figure hitting 3% levels at the moment – this is very significant,” Hwang said. Building more capacity takes massive investment. Suppliers got worried that market projections were too rosy, so they held back on expanding their pricey facilities. “Now, the suppliers need to add capacity quickly but as we know, it takes 2-3 years to add semiconductor manufacturing fabs” Hanbury explained. Nvidia’s “Seismic” Change Nvidia runs the AI chip market, and a recent product change has made things worse for consumer electronics suppliers. The company’s increasingly using Low-Power Double Data Rate memory because it’s more power efficient. The thing is, Samsung and Apple use that same memory technology. Supply chains used to handle demand from just a handful of big electronics makers. Now Nvidia’s in the mix too, competing for identical components. “We also see a bigger risk on the horizon is with advanced memory as Nvidia’s recent pivot to LPDDR means they’re a customer on the scale of a major smartphone maker — a seismic shift for the supply chain which can’t easily absorb this scale of demand,” Hwang said.

According to a report from Bloomberg, the problem is a software failure inside Airbus A320 jets that regulators said must be fixed before planes take off again.

The European Union Aviation Safety Agency ordered the emergency patch late Friday, and it came with a very clear instruction: no fix, no flight.

The A320 is the most-flown commercial jet on earth, with more than 11,000 in service, and over 6,000 need this fix now. Holiday traffic is already stretched thin. And now more than half of these jets may be pulled from rotation unless airlines act fast.

This directive came just days after a JetBlue flight from Cancun to Newark dropped suddenly mid-air, without the pilots doing anything. No one got hurt, but that plane had to land in Tampa. And the flight computer was blamed.

Airlines ground planes and delay flights to apply the fix

Investigators say the issue is some “intense solar radiation” found in a system called ELAC 2 (it controls how the plane handles in the air) that mess with its data.

The ELAC system, made by Thales in France, controls key stabilizer functions and flight limits. It’s part of Airbus’s fly-by-wire technology, which relies on electronic signals instead of traditional controls.

A spokesperson for Airbus said the company is following regulator instructions and knows this will “lead to operational disruptions to passengers and customers.” Depending on how old each aircraft is, the update is either a quick software download or a full hardware replacement, which means longer ground time.

The Federal Aviation Administration in the U.S. mirrored the European alert. About 545 planes registered in the U.S. were affected. American Airlines said 209 of its aircraft needed checking, and by Friday night, fewer than 150 still hadn’t been updated.

In India, IndiGo said 200 planes required inspection, but 160 had already been cleared by Saturday afternoon. They didn’t have to cancel any flights. In Colombia, Avianca said over 70% of its fleet was affected, and they’re freezing ticket sales until December 8.

Over in Japan, ANA Holdings canceled 95 flights on Saturday, impacting around 13,200 passengers. In China, China Southern Airlines saw 452 flights delayed, that’s about 20% of its schedule. EasyJet, operating across Europe, reported 323 flights delayed as of noon in Hong Kong.

Airlines complete urgent software upgrade as regulators warn of safety risk

Airlines in Australia and New Zealand also grounded A320s to push through the fix. Jetstar, owned by Qantas, and Air New Zealand halted operations on some flights. Wizz Air, based in Hungary, has an all-Airbus fleet and said all affected A320 jets were updated overnight. Their flights resumed normally.

The UK Civil Aviation Authority warned that if airlines don’t upgrade their systems “over the days ahead,” their A320s will be grounded by Sunday.

Not every British carrier is affected. But British Airways, which flies nearly 150 A320s, is in the clear and said no passengers will notice any changes.

Both the A320neo and older A320 models are involved. Airbus confirmed the fix applies to all variants in the family. The neo version already had its own headache last year, when Pratt & Whitney engines started breaking down, forcing jets into early maintenance. Now it’s the software’s turn.

The A320 became Airbus’s breakout success after it launched in the late 1980s. The lineup includes the A319, A320, and the larger A321. A few years ago, the company added new fuel-saving engines, calling them the “new engine option.” All of them use the same core computer system to fly.

This whole situation is another reminder that aviation depends on stable software more than ever. A single corrupted code can throw off a plane’s systems.

Boeing knows this all too well. After two 737 Max crashes tied to a failed MCAS system, the company grounded fleets globally. That tragedy rewrote the rules for software checks. Now, it’s Airbus getting hit with a warning shot of its own.

One of the latest entrants causing a buzz is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a DeFi-project positioning itself at the intersection of lending, liquidity, and token utility scalability. Mutuum Finance is on its sixth presale round with tokens available for sale at $0.035. The project has raised over $15.6 million and over 16,220 individuals support it. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming a valuable coin for investors tracking undervalued assets in an uncertain market.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Holds Around $0.00001293 During Cautious Momentum

Shiba Inu (SHIB) is priced at $0.00001293, with intraday highs and lows of $0.00001271 and $0.00001316, respectively. Charts signal that the token is yet to consolidate, moving between support around $0.0000121 and resistance at approximately $0.0000130. Experts note that a breach of this resistance will lead to $0.0000152, while a drop below support will challenge lower levels. In the meantime, investor sentiment is slowly turning toward new DeFi initiatives like Mutuum Finance, which are starting to set the tone for the wider altcoin market.

Mutuum Finance Presale Momentum

Sixth MUTM token sale round reaffirms the sustainability of the project with an all-time high of $15.6 million and logging over 16,220 investors. Investors in this round will enjoy humongous profits once the token goes live. Mutuum Finance is building an entire ecosystem which will feature a stablecoin, on the Ethereum chain for maximum security and stability.

$50,000 Bug Bounty Program

In order to ensure the safety of the platform, Mutuum Finance has initiated a Bug Bounty Program in association with CertiK with the reward value up to $50,000 USDT. The system provides an open invitation to white-hat hackers, security researchers, and developers who are interested in discovering and reporting bugs. The bugs are graded by severity score-wise, i.e., critical major minor and low. The exercise fortifies platform security protects user balances and enhances investor confidence.

Development and Community Incentives

Mutuum Finance also initiated a $100,000 giveaway for the purpose of incentivizing early investors, rewarding new users, and engaging the community. Ten lucky winners will get $10,000 MUTM tokens for joining the project and introducing new users. The activities are focused on growth with stability within the ecosystem.

Market Risk, Volatility, and Liquidity Management

The protocol stabilizes and regulates market exposure with limits and liquidation levels and compensates liquidators in the event of illiquidity. Volatility in an asset straight away impacts Loan-to-Value ratio conservativeness or aggressiveness as well as liquidation levels. The more volatile, the more aggressive parameters; less volatile, the more conservative parameters. Risk rankings also regulate reserve multipliers so the protocol is secure, stable, and realistic under any market conditions.

Community-Led Development and Security

Mutuum Finance not only guarantees a scalable and secure DeFi protocol but also a community of users, token holders, and investors who are lucky enough to not only benefit from the security dividends of the platform but also the initiatives by the community. Since the presale process started, MUTM has revealed incentives to reward the users, establish the community, and give rise to long-term stability for the project.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fast emerging as one of the most promising tokens under $1, overtaking meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB). Already in Stage 6 of its presale at $0.035, MUTM has already collected over $15.6M with 16,220+ investors, which is a clear sign of unprecedented demand.

A legal battle concerning Louisiana’s congressional maps has been extended to the U.S. Supreme Court, prompting a new examination of the Voting Rights Act’s minority and districting protections nearly 60 years after its passage.

President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 into law on Aug. 6, 1965. The law aimed to remove barriers that prevented African Americans from voting in many parts of the country. The act banned literacy tests and outlawed poll taxes, among other restrictions that infringed on voting rights.

The act also authorized federal examiners to oversee elections. The 15th Amendment was enforced through this and increased voter participation tremendously among Black Americans.

A key part of this act is Section 2. According to the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, it prohibits the use of practices or procedures that result in limitations on the right to vote based on race, color or membership of one of the minority groups listed in Section 4 (f)(2) of the act.

This section has been used in numerous court cases to challenge district maps or election systems that may dilute the voting strength of minority groups. Section 2 applies nationwide and does not require federal approval for voting changes beforehand.

Presently, the Supreme Court is considering Louisiana v. Callais, a case involving the state’s congressional redistricting plan drawn after the 2020 census. Black residents in the state make up about one-third of the population. The original plan only included one majority-Black district out of six. A federal district court found that the plan likely violated Section 2, due to the dilution of voting strength and ordered a redraw to include a second majority-Black district.

“The Constitution requires a national census every 10 years to reapportion political power as to where people live. In 2020, the census the legislature drew only had one majority-minority district, resulting in five Republican and one Democratic congresspersons,” said Dr. Peter Petrakis, associate professor of history and political science at Southeastern.

In response, the Louisiana legislature passed a new map in 2024 with two majority-Black districts. Another group of voters argued that this violated the Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case and is now considering whether to create another majority-Black district in compliance with Section 2, or raise concerns related to race-based redistricting.

The potential outcome of the decision made by the Supreme Court could have major implications for redistricting moving forward.

This decision could include the legalization of racial gerrymandering, which is a type of gerrymandering meant to dilute the voting power of a given racial group. The outcome could thin out minority voting rights and protections, changing the party makeup across the country. Republicans could gain several seats if the Supreme Court overturns Section 2.

As of right now, the Supreme Court has heard oral arguments on March 24 and Oct. 15. The decision is still pending.

The court’s decision will clarify how states reconcile adherence to the Voting Rights Act with constitutional redistricting restrictions.",https://lionsroarnews.com/38411/louisiana-redistricting-case-brought-to-supreme-court/news/,2025-12-09 19:12:44+00:00,"Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

On Tuesday, Nov. 18, the Alumni Visitor Center hosted “Southeastern 100: Legacy Unsealed,” a dual celebration marking the opening of the 75th Anniversary Time Capsule Exhibition and the official launch of “Southeastern 100: The Story of Southeastern Louisiana University’s First Century.”

The limited-edition book chronicles the university’s century-long history.

Dr. Chelsea Slack, assistant professor of communication and media studies and the faculty adviser for The Lion’s Roar, authored the comprehensive history of the university’s most recent quarter-century (2000-2025).

Slack’s work updated the historical record originally chronicled by former English professor Ronald Harris, who wrote the history of the first 75 years in 2000. Sheri Gibson, assistant director for marketing and content, also served as an editor and author for the project, melding Harris’ past work with Slack’s new contributions to create a cohesive narrative.

Slack said that the history of this era was largely written through the lens of student media.

“The primary source of information for this section was thousands of pages of archival material, most of it from The Lion’s Roar student newspaper and Le Souvenir yearbook. These student-created records encompass the kinds of things that are often easy to overlook: construction updates, policy changes, campus events and student opinions,” she said.

Slack emphasized that the work created by Student Publications provided the necessary evidence to build the historical record.

“It is the most detailed, human account of how the university has grown and changed over the past 25 years,” Slack noted. “Ultimately, this history exists because our students chose to notice things, to ask questions and to leave a record.”

In addition to the student archives, the book incorporates local news coverage, press releases, planning documents and writing from the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. However, Slack credited the students who worked in the newsroom as the driving force behind the narrative.

“This part of the book would not have been possible without the countless number of student journalists and writers who have walked the halls of our campus. Those who, in addition to their daily lives as students, took pen to paper, hands to keyboards and fingers to screens to write what has become Southeastern’s recent history. Their work lies at the very heart of this story,” Slack said.

The 2000-2025 section was a collaborative effort involving several The Lion’s Roar alumni.

Troy Granger, who served as a graduate research assistant for the project and is now an instructor in the Department of Communication and Media Studies, spearheaded the digitization of The Lion’s Roar archives for the past 25 years. Granger and Slack are currently considering grant funding options to potentially take all of The Lion’s Roar’s archives online.

“Doing research for the book taught me so much about the history of Southeastern and what the school has persevered through to become what it is today. It’s fascinating how the university has grown so much during its lifetime. It makes me proud to be an alumnus,” Granger said, adding, “I loved looking through the old newspapers.”

Recent alum Chase Gispert led the writing for the 2000-2025 sports section, an endeavor he began as part of the capstone course for his communication degree.

“In researching the past 100 years of Southeastern sports history, I learned a lot about the rich tradition we have here in Hammond, America,” said Gispert, the long-serving sports editor for The Lion’s Roar, who now holds the same position at the local Hammond Daily Star.

“SLU Athletics brings the local community together. From Strawberry Stadium to the University Center, there’s nothing like watching athletes in the Green and Gold representing Southeastern,” Gispert noted.

Student Publications Director Lorraine Peppo served as the ultimate fact checker and a seemingly endless well of institutional knowledge, extending back to even before her own time on campus. Former copy editors Hydee Holsapple and Jacob White also volunteered their time as graduate students to copyedit the text.

Piecing together these thousands of pages of student work meant sorting through a wide range of perspectives to make sense of the university’s larger story. It was through this process that the editors identified a recurring theme.

Gibson noted the stories collected throughout the book reflect Southeastern’s ability to recover from hardships, including wars, pandemics and turbulent political climates.

“And with each hardship, we’ve not only come back, but we’ve come back bigger, we’ve grown, and we’ve come back strong with even more impact,” Gibson said.

Alongside the book launch, the “Legacy Unsealed” exhibit offered attendees a glimpse into the daily lives of Lions from a quarter-century ago. The event showcased a unique, one-night-only exhibition of artifacts not part of the permanent collection.

While most items dated back to the 2000 sealing, curators Gibson and Trahan were shocked to discover a piece of history hidden inside that was much older: a belt buckle from between 1925 and 1927, when Southeastern was still a junior college.

Trahan, who compiled archived photos from the last 100 years, said he wanted the book’s images to show “100 years of joy” from students and faculty. He noted that visual history is just as vital as written history.

“I think that those pictures kind of tell the story just as much as the text does,” Trahan said.

Just as the photos and time capsule artifacts preserve specific moments in time, the written history relies on those who documented the daily life of the university as it happened. For the last 25 years, that record has been primarily maintained by student reporters, according to Slack.

“As the saying goes, ‘Journalism is the first rough draft of history.’ This quote sits at the bedrock of the journalistic ethos: to write is to bear witness; to write is to not be forgotten,” Slack said. “We write not for ourselves, but so that others may remember.”",https://lionsroarnews.com/38357/centennial-book-time-capsule-exhibition-bring-slu-history-to-light/news/,2025-12-02 20:29:48+00:00,"Getting your Trinity Audio player ready... On Tuesday, Nov. 18, the Alumni Visitor Center hosted “Southeastern 100: Legacy Unsealed,” a dual celebration marking the opening of the 75th Anniversary Time Capsule Exhibition and the official launch of “Southeastern 100: The Story of Southeastern Louisiana University’s First Century.” The limited-edition book chronicles the university’s century-long history. Dr. Chelsea Slack, assistant professor of communication and media studies and the faculty adviser for The Lion’s Roar, authored the comprehensive history of the university’s most recent quarter-century (2000-2025). Slack’s work updated the historical record originally chronicled by former English professor Ronald Harris, who wrote the history of the first 75 years in 2000. Sheri Gibson, assistant director for marketing and content, also served as an editor and author for the project, melding Harris’ past work with Slack’s new contributions to create a cohesive narrative. Slack said that the history of this era was largely written through the lens of student media. “The primary source of information for this section was thousands of pages of archival material, most of it from The Lion’s Roar student newspaper and Le Souvenir yearbook. These student-created records encompass the kinds of things that are often easy to overlook: construction updates, policy changes, campus events and student opinions,” she said. Slack emphasized that the work created by Student Publications provided the necessary evidence to build the historical record. “It is the most detailed, human account of how the university has grown and changed over the past 25 years,” Slack noted. “Ultimately, this history exists because our students chose to notice things, to ask questions and to leave a record.” In addition to the student archives, the book incorporates local news coverage, press releases, planning documents and writing from the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. However, Slack credited the students who worked in the newsroom as the driving force behind the narrative. “This part of the book would not have been possible without the countless number of student journalists and writers who have walked the halls of our campus. Those who, in addition to their daily lives as students, took pen to paper, hands to keyboards and fingers to screens to write what has become Southeastern’s recent history. Their work lies at the very heart of this story,” Slack said. The 2000-2025 section was a collaborative effort involving several The Lion’s Roar alumni. Troy Granger, who served as a graduate research assistant for the project and is now an instructor in the Department of Communication and Media Studies, spearheaded the digitization of The Lion’s Roar archives for the past 25 years.

What is “Friendsgiving?” Friendsgiving is a feast among friends, much like the traditional Thanksgiving holiday, but it is centered around additional connections and community beyond the family circle.

Friends from across the United States come together during the month of November to share a more relaxed, potluck-style meal, where everyone brings a dish and enjoys each other’s company, especially when Thanksgiving can be lonely for some people who are far from family or have strained relationships with their family.

Friendsgiving has gained popularity over the years, originating on social media sites like Twitter and MySpace and later appearing in lifestyle magazines. This concept gained traction quickly due to a growing need for younger generations to build community, leading many to celebrate the idea of a “chosen family.”

The concept of “chosen family” is central to the Friendsgiving phenomenon. Faculty advisor and board member of the Lavender Lions, Dr. Settembrino, defined it clearly: “Chosen family is a term that trans and queer people use to describe the close friendships we build with one another that are often stronger than familial relationships.”

This focus on chosen family is visible right here on campus; clubs such as the Lavender Lions are tight-knit communities that understand the importance of having a chosen family firsthand. The club is attending the Third Annual Queer Northshore Friendsgiving, and the invitation is extended to the public. This event is free to everyone and will take place at Tandem Coffee and Cocktails in Mandeville on November 27. RSVP at queernorthshore.org.

In the previous year, Queer Northshore created a “family tree,” which Settembrino described as “an interactive art installation that allowed participants to write their names and positive messages on paper leaves that can be attached to the large tree. It symbolized our coming together as a community and family in a really powerful way.”

A chosen family is special because it can offer a new sense of belonging and help uplift people in ways traditional families may not. Friendsgiving with chosen family, like that within the Lavender Lions, upholds the values of a traditional Thanksgiving while bringing together newfound friends and circles of peace.

The power of a chosen family to create a sense of belonging isn’t limited to one group. Throughout Southeastern’s Greek life, you can also see the trend of people coming together with shared values and compassion to support one another, often becoming as close as family. Friendsgiving traditions have become popular sisterhood and brotherhood events, making sure each member is cared for and supported this holiday season.

Students across campus, particularly those in college away from home, echo this sentiment. Junior strategic communications major and member of Tri Sigma sorority, Emerson Milligan said, “Friendsgiving is one of the most important times to show up for your people who love you and cherish you no matter what. I always cherish the moments I have with my friends who have become my sisters.”

Freshman early childhood education major and member of Alpha Sigma Tau sorority, Emma Rodriguez, also noted, “Friendsgiving is a moment to slow down, share good food, laugh about everything, and appreciate the people who make life feel lighter.”

As college students move away from home, some further than others, holidays become more challenging to manage. Friendsgiving is such an impactful holiday among younger generations in America because it emphasizes the importance of showing up for each other and providing continuous support throughout life.

Senior communication sciences and disorders major and member of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc., Mia Spears stated, “This year we are doing a Friendsmas instead of Friendsgiving. But it brings me closer to my sorors and allows us to fellowship in a relaxed setting. It really feels like a found family/home away from home.”

Minden native and freshman English education major Jaliyah Oliver is a member of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc., and has a personal connection to the special holiday. She stated, “Since I’m from up North Louisiana and my family is four hours away, I’ve felt very supported by my sorors and close friends. In a way, they are all like my family. Down here having my own little family, I would say Friendsgiving is super important, especially if you are like me and four hours away from home.”

For some people, Friendsgiving is more than a meal; it celebrates the bonds of friendship that cannot be broken.

The Hammond City Council approved the renewal of more than 100 alcohol licenses during its most recent meeting after a unanimous vote among participating members, with four council members voting in favor and one abstaining.

The vote affects 106 businesses that depend on alcohol licenses, including restaurants, bars, grocery stores and convenience stores. Devon A. Wells, Kip Andrews, Sam DiVittorio and Steven J. Leon voted in favor, while Carlee White Gonzales abstained.

Gonzales said she abstained from the vote to follow LA ethics laws, as her husband, Ryan, owns a minor interest in one of the Hammond businesses with a liquor license.

Before the meeting, DiVittorio emphasized that the council’s vote should not be interpreted as an attempt to make Hammond a dry city or stop alcohol sales.

“We live in a college town in south Louisiana — we are not becoming a dry city. That is not something I would ever support. Local businesses will continue operating as they always have,” DiVittorio said.

He also said the issues were expected to be resolved before the licenses expire at the end of the year.

“This is just the latest example of poor communication from the administration. These concerns are not new. Issues like this should be resolved before they ever reach the meeting,” DiVittorio said.

Prior to the vote, a downtown business owner expressed concern about how the uncertainty could impact their operations and revenue.

“It would definitely affect our staff. We would have to cut stuff. Alcohol is one of the main things people come here to enjoy: a beer or a margarita. It’s part of the identity of the restaurant,” the owner said.

Alcohol sales generate a significant portion of income for many establishments in Hammond’s downtown and surrounding areas, where dining and nightlife are central to the community’s social life.

Sophomore communication major Matthew Cuccia also shared his thoughts ahead of the meeting, noting that a potential restriction would cause more harm than good.

“You can ban things legally, but people will still find ways around it, and it would just create more problems. I also think new college students would see a town without alcohol sales and wonder why they’d want to go there,” Cuccia said.

Senior mechanical engineering technology major Ryan Sheck said he agreed limiting or removing alcohol sales would hurt Hammond’s economy.

“We rely so much on restaurants and venues around here, and if those businesses can’t sell alcohol, they’re going to take a big hit financially. It is not a wise idea to shut that down,” Sheck said.

During the meeting, The Brown Door introduced into the record that it had been removed from the city’s list of businesses because its license was suspended for 90 days. The suspension will be lifted on Nov. 21, and the council will revisit the matter in December.

With the renewals approved, more than 100 Hammond businesses have clarity moving into the end of the year.",https://lionsroarnews.com/38335/hammond-city-council-renews-alcohol-licenses/news/,2025-11-24 23:00:10+00:00,"Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

SLU’s Department of Music and Performing Arts has organized several dance concerts for Fall 2025. The department’s dance company, the Dance Performance Project, put on the “LA Strong: 14 Victims” concert directed by Director of Dance Keith “Skip” Costa from Sept. 30 to Oct. 1 as part of Fanfare, SLU’s annual fall arts festival.

Senior business management major Kairah Senegal’s thesis concert, Bienvenue la Fin, is set to premiere tonight in Pottle Auditorium at 7:30 p.m.

“LA Strong: 14 Victims” was a concert in tribute to the victims of the terror attack in New Orleans on New Year’s. Testimonies from the victims’ family and friends preceded each dance sequence in the concert. The faculty director and three student choreographers began the production in Spring 2025 and had five weeks to choreograph. The mother of one of the victims, Hubert Gautreaux, was in attendance on opening night, and that night’s performance was dedicated to him.

Junior dance major Angelina Neal, a member of the Dance Performance Project, discussed the process of rehearsing for the concert and how the video portion of the performances was integrated with the choreography during the latter stages of production.

“We weren’t aware of the bigger picture so we were just rehearsing regularly until show week, and we were able to see the projector film and how much of a bigger theme we were contributing to,” Neal said.

SLU’s dance program has incorporated video into its previous fall productions, in addition to dance courses. Videographer Stephen Gerhardt provided the footage used during the concert. The purpose of the video elements was to show who these victims were and further engage the audience.

The concert’s focus was on using the medium of dance to explore how the attack impacted the local community and people who knew the victims, while also conveying the emotions that remain present.

For Neal, the balancing act of processing emotions on stage while also maintaining structure as a dancer was a challenge during practice.

“Just showing up and trusting yourself because you really never know what’s going to come up, you just have to trust it will pass and if you allow yourself to feel it, that everything will be okay and that you can feel those feelings when they come up for you, because that’s the whole point. Releasing those feelings through dance and being honest,” Neal said.

Costa expressed positive feelings toward the concert and the reception from the audience.

“This is one of my top two dance concerts of all time that we have created here at Southeastern since I began teaching in 2013. I am so proud of this group of company dancers who have allowed themselves to be emotional, vulnerable and to dignify and pay their respects to other human beings who many never knew personally,” Costa said.

Using dance as a means of expressing personal feelings and understanding oneself is a theme that finds itself in Senegal’s thesis concert. Senegal said she used experiences and challenges from her freshman year and came into her own as a senior. The show’s title, “Welcome the end” in French, serves as a personal reflection of Senegal’s roots in Lafayette.

Senegal’s experience with dance goes back before her time at SLU, where she performed with her middle and high school dance teams. She credits her time at SLU with helping her discover her own style as a dancer and fostering her growth as a young adult.

Senior general studies major and member of Dance Performance Project, Trinity Brown, described a bonding moment during rehearsal.

“When one dancer in rehearsals says, ‘I am very confused,’ it makes you just giggle and not giggle at them. Giggling with them because everyone is probably confused. Learning choreography and working with Kairah for years, that girl surely knows how to make a dance hard to learn, but that is what makes them so beautiful on the stage,” Brown said.

With the concert date approaching, Senegal expressed excitement about her work, as well as the efforts of everyone involved in the production.

“I was very nervous last week, but this week everything started to come together, and what I

have imagined, I started to see. I’m very excited to see how it all comes together with the

lights and music during tech and even more excited for everyone to experience what I have

these past four years,” Senegal said.

Southeastern Louisiana University will soon begin its fall 2025 semester and with it comes new faces, fresh opportunities and an exciting lineup for the university theatre’s mainstage season. A total of four shows will take center stage during the Fall 2025 and Spring 2026 semesters.

Dr. Anne-Liese Fox, theatre instructor at SLU, said, “We are not skipping a beat and we have four exciting productions lined up for the 2025-2026 Mainstage season. It is going to be a thrilling time.”

Premiering first in the mainstage lineup is author and playwright Rob Florence’s “Katrina’s Path.” Running from Wednesday, Oct. 22-Saturday, Oct. 25, “Katrina’s Path” is a collection of standalone monologues portraying seven New Orleanians and their experiences before, amid and in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and the breaking of the levees.

“Katrina’s Path” was first produced at the University of New Orleans and would later be published by Original Works Publishing in 2007. Florence’s play was the first published play about Hurricane Katrina and was a regional finalist in the Kennedy Center American College Theatre Festival.

Florence, who received his master’s in playwriting at the University of New Orleans in 2008, is also a representative of the Dramatists Guild and a co-founder of the Gulf Coast Playwrights. Other works from Florence include “Burn K-Doe Burn!” and “Holy Wars.”

Carter Cortez, SLU’s Theatre Society (APO) Vice President, says “Katrina’s Path promises to be a deeply emotional and challenging production — the kind of show that truly pushes actors, which I always appreciate.”

Next on the mainstage lineup is “Winds of Change: Truth, Power and Blood An Evening of Modernist Drama” curated by Southeastern instructor Chad Winters, and set to run from Wednesday, Nov. 19-Saturday, Nov. 22.

“Winds of Change” is a collection of scenes and monologues from early modern drama and its most influential playwrights, such as John Steinbeck and Tennessee Williams.

The third production in the limelight is Howard Ashman’s “Little Shop of Horrors” which will run from Friday, March 13-Saturday, March 14 and from Friday, March 20-Saturday, March 21.

The iconic and critically acclaimed musical follows a flower shop assistant named Seymour, who happens upon a peculiar, bloodthirsty plant, and is tasked with making sure it stays fed.

Directed by both Southeastern alumnus and instructor Jeff Polito, “Little Shop of Horrors” is a co-production with the Columbia Theatre and Southeastern’s Department of Music and Performing Arts.

The finale for Southeastern Theatre’s mainstage season is Inkslinger Winner Bella Poynton’s “The Appliance Department,” showing from Wednesday, April 29-Saturday, May 2.

“The Appliance Department” is about two store robots who yearn to be purchased and brought to a loving home, until a new model arrives and sparks a rebellious dream of freedom.

Every year, Southeastern Theatre hosts an international playwriting contest where the winning playwright receives a fully produced production as part of the mainstage season.

Poynton’s prize-winning play is “touching and humorous as it asks ethical questions of human consciousness and our limits of human empathy,” according to Fox.

Her appointment follows the resignation of K.P. Sharma Oli, whose administration was forced to step down amid intense nationwide protests sparked by a controversial social media ban.

President Ramchandra Paudel formally administered the oath of office to the 73-year-old Karki, just three days after Oli’s resignation. The unrest leading to this transition has been described as the most severe Nepal has experienced in decades.

In New Delhi, India welcomed the formation of the new Interim government in Nepal.

In an offiical release, MEA said, “We welcome the formation of a new Interim Government in Nepal, led by Right Honourable Sushila Karki. We are hopeful that this would help in fostering peace and stability. As a close neighbour, a fellow democracy and a long-term development partner, India will continue to work closely with Nepal for the well-being and prosperity of our two peoples and countries.”

Sushila Karki was selected to lead Nepal's interim government following a pivotal meeting between President Ramchandra Paudel, the Nepal Army chief, and representatives of the Gen Z-led youth protests that had driven the anti-government demonstrations.

Karki, a former chief justice widely respected for her integrity and straightforward approach, emerged as a consensus choice after multiple rounds of discussions. Her background includes legal studies at Banaras Hindu University, further solidifying her credentials for the role during this period of national transition.

In the first meeting of her cabinet, she is likely to recommend to the president the dissolution of the Parliament as per an understanding reached during the negotiations between the youth leaders and the president, top sources said.

President Paudel also consulted leaders of all major political parties, legal experts and civil society leaders separately before deciding to appoint Karki as the caretaker prime minister.

The major demands by the Gen Z protesters included checking corruption, ending political disorder, and nepotism.

The students-led ""Gen Z"" protests that began against a government ban on social media expanded into a larger campaign reflecting growing public criticism of the Oli dispensation and the country's political elite over alleged corruption and apathy towards the common people.

Though the ban on social media was lifted on Monday night, the intensity of protests grew on Tuesday with the focus of the agitation shifting to alleged corruption and luxury lifestyles of the political elite.

In his resignation letter to President Paudel, Oli had cited the ""extraordinary circumstances"" facing Nepal and said he is quitting to pave the way for a ""constitutional and political"" resolution of the current situation.

Earlier on Friday, Speaker of Nepal's House of Representatives Devaraj Ghimire and Chairman of the National Assembly Narayan Dahal called for resolving the ongoing political deadlock ""within the framework of the Constitution.""

Latest data from Nepal police said that at least 51 people, including an Indian national, died in the 'Gen Z'-led violent protests that began on Monday.

Meanwhile, the Hotel Association Nepal (HAN) on Friday said Nepal's hotel industry, a vital revenue earner of its tourism-driven economy, has suffered a loss of over 25 billion Nepalese rupees after nearly two dozen hotels across the country were vandalised, looted or torched during the student-led anti-government protests.

Among the worst hit is the Hilton Hotel in Kathmandu, which alone reported damages exceeding ₹8 billion, My Republica news portal reported, quoting a HAN statement. Nepalese authorities announced temporary measures to facilitate foreign nationals stranded in the country due to the ongoing curfew in the Kathmandu Valley, PTI reported.

Her appointment follows the resignation of K.P. Sharma Oli, whose administration was forced to step down amid intense nationwide protests sparked by a controversial social media ban. President Ramchandra Paudel formally administered the oath of office to the 73-year-old Karki, just three days after Oli’s resignation. The unrest leading to this transition has been described as the most severe Nepal has experienced in decades. In New Delhi, India welcomed the formation of the new Interim government in Nepal. In an offiical release, MEA said, “We welcome the formation of a new Interim Government in Nepal, led by Right Honourable Sushila Karki. We are hopeful that this would help in fostering peace and stability. As a close neighbour, a fellow democracy and a long-term development partner, India will continue to work closely with Nepal for the well-being and prosperity of our two peoples and countries.” Sushila Karki was selected to lead Nepal's interim government following a pivotal meeting between President Ramchandra Paudel, the Nepal Army chief, and representatives of the Gen Z-led youth protests that had driven the anti-government demonstrations. Karki, a former chief justice widely respected for her integrity and straightforward approach, emerged as a consensus choice after multiple rounds of discussions. Her background includes legal studies at Banaras Hindu University, further solidifying her credentials for the role during this period of national transition. In the first meeting of her cabinet, she is likely to recommend to the president the dissolution of the Parliament as per an understanding reached during the negotiations between the youth leaders and the president, top sources said. President Paudel also consulted leaders of all major political parties, legal experts and civil society leaders separately before deciding to appoint Karki as the caretaker prime minister. The major demands by the Gen Z protesters included checking corruption, ending political disorder, and nepotism. The students-led ""Gen Z"" protests that began against a government ban on social media expanded into a larger campaign reflecting growing public criticism of the Oli dispensation and the country's political elite over alleged corruption and apathy towards the common people. Though the ban on social media was lifted on Monday night, the intensity of protests grew on Tuesday with the focus of the agitation shifting to alleged corruption and luxury lifestyles of the political elite. In his resignation letter to President Paudel, Oli had cited the ""extraordinary circumstances"" facing Nepal and said he is quitting to pave the way for a ""constitutional and political"" resolution of the current situation. Earlier on Friday, Speaker of Nepal's House of Representatives Devaraj Ghimire and Chairman of the National Assembly Narayan Dahal called for resolving the ongoing political deadlock ""within the framework of the Constitution.""

At the heart of the case is whether popular titles such as fantasy sports and online rummy should be treated as games of skill or as gambling. The verdict, expected later this year, will determine whether startups face nearly $20 billion (approximately ₹1.5 trillion) in retrospective tax claims from the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) and whether the industry comes under a unified national law or remains subject to a patchwork of state-level rules.

But the hearings have also revealed a deeper problem: the industry’s inability to present a united front. Divisions between fantasy-sports operators such as Dream11, rummy and poker platforms such as Gameskraft, and companies straddling both camps such as Games24x7 have weakened their case.

Industry divided over legality

India’s online gaming industry generates about ₹10,000 crore in annual revenue, according to industry estimates. The sector is split between fantasy sports platforms, rummy and poker operators, and gambling or horse-racing ventures.

Sporta Technologies, which runs Dream11, offers fantasy sports where users pay to assemble virtual teams and win if their players perform in real games. Gameskraft Technologies runs online versions of rummy, while Games24x7 operates across both categories.

The Supreme Court case, led by Justice Jamshed Burjor Pardiwala, consolidated more than 100 cases involving over 90 companies, casinos, and turf clubs. Over five months, the two-judge bench held 31 days of hearings totalling about 100 hours before closing arguments on 12 August. A ruling is expected later this year.

The proceedings followed more than two years of legal battles over state-level bans, appeals, and successive tax demands by the DGGI. Most high courts so far have found that fantasy sports and rummy require skill and are distinct from gambling.

Still, the hearings laid bare rifts.

A senior advocate representing a real-money gaming startup told Mint that the challenges “go all the way back to fundamental discord between the various parties.""

He described six broad groupings, including fantasy gaming firms such as Dream11; gambling and horse-racing ventures; rummy and poker platforms such as Gameskraft; and three sets of startups divided by whether they want strong regulation, no regulation, or a middle ground. “The polarization in the industry is too high,"" he said.

Dream11 declined to comment. Queries to Gameskraft and Games24x7 went unanswered at the time of publishing.

These divisions, five other senior lawyers involved in the hearings told Mint, are central to the sector’s fate. For example, during one session, senior counsel Arvind Datar, representing one of the 95 total parties from the online gaming industry, argued that fantasy sports involve skill and are not gambling. No other parties flagged fantasy games separately, underlining divisions within the industry.

Mint has seen a copy of the written submissions made by online gaming firms.

By contrast, N. Venkataraman, in arguments before the Pardiwala bench, contended that while rummy and poker involve skill, fantasy sports do not require actual knowledge of the game and instead rely on “placing their hopes and dreams on athletes that do."" An emailed query to Venkataraman did not receive an immediate response.

“It is only natural that companies involved in the hearing will look to protect their own interests, which went on to expose the divides across the entire industry,"" one of the five lawyers, cited earlier, said.

Fantasy-sports lawyers have long argued that assembling virtual teams requires skill. But states such as Tamil Nadu and Karnataka have compared the practice to online gambling and sought to ban it.

One of the lawyers said the “biggest reason why the case got escalated to this level is because the industry could not come to a consensus on regulation, taxation or legal issues to begin with.""

Regulation remains elusive

In 2023, the Centre amended the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules to bring online gaming under a framework for approving titles permitted in India. The rules proposed a self-regulatory body (SRB), but rival companies objected to each proposal, leaving the industry unregulated.

Mint reported in February that the Ministry of Home Affairs later considered central regulation but delayed further action pending the Supreme Court outcome.

“Through the course of the hearing too, the justices hearing the case also noted that there is discrepancy even in the industry’s understanding of which titles involved skill, and which largely relied on chance. This could eventually be detrimental to the overall industry, even though startups fundamentally offer differing games,"" another lawyer, representing one of the startups, said.

In his submissions, Abhishek Manu Singhvi argued that the industry’s net revenue in FY25 was just over ₹10,000 crore ($1.1 billion) far below the DGGI’s tax claim of nearly $20 billion.

The bus was returning from the Pashupatinath Temple in Kathmandu.

The alleged incident took place on September 9 near Sonauli on the India-Nepal border, when the agitators targeted the bus carrying 49 Indians.

""We were returning after having darshan (at the Pashupatinath Temple), when suddenly a mob surrounded our bus and attacked without reason. There were women and elderly people among the passengers, but the protesters did not care,"" bus driver Ramu Nishad told reporters in Sonauli.

According to reports, the local authorities admitted the injured to a hospital in Kathmandu, while the remaining passengers were flown back to India on a special plane arranged by the Indian Embassy with the help of the Nepalese government.

Death Toll Rises The Gen Z protesters, which spearheaded the anti-government agitation across Nepal, on Thursday said Parliament must be dissolved and the Constitution should be amended to reflect the will of the people.

According to the Nepal’s Ministry of Health and Population, the death toll from the nationwide protests rose to 51 on Friday.

Of these, 30 individuals were killed by gunshots, while 21 others succumbed to burns, wounds, and other injuries, the ministry said.

The fatalities include one Indian national and three police personnel, said a report by The Kathmandu Post citing a co-spokesperson for Nepal Police, Ramesh Thapa.

The protesters have been demanding an end to ""institutionalised corruption and favouritism"" in governance. They want the government to be more accountable and transparent in its decision-making processes.

Public frustration deepened further when the ""Nepo Babies"" trend on social media exposed the lavish lifestyles of politicians' children, highlighting the economic disparity between them and ordinary citizens.

According to outage tracking site Downdetector.com, reports of disruptions began pouring in earlier in the day, peaking at over 93,800 complaints by 6:19 pm ET.

What caused the Discord outage? Discord initially reported an issue affecting certain communities — known on the platform as guilds — leaving some members unable to connect. The company’s status page later warned that the problem had “worsened,” leading to widespread availability issues across its network.

Engineers worked through the evening to restore service, with the company confirming all systems were back online by late Monday night. While Discord has not provided a detailed explanation of the root cause, the platform indicated that the matter was being closely monitored to prevent further disruptions.

What does the ‘guilds unavailability’ error mean? Users across the United States reported widespread difficulties accessing Discord on Monday, with many encountering a “Guilds Unavailability” error message. The notification stated: “We are investigating an issue where some guilds are unavailable to some members.”

On Discord, a “guild” refers to a server — a virtual community space where users can engage in conversations, share media, and collaborate in real time. When the “Guilds Unavailable” message appears, it generally indicates that certain servers, or in some cases all servers, are temporarily inaccessible. This may occur due to server outages, surges in traffic, or technical malfunctions on Discord’s network.

Typically, such problems are addressed directly by Discord’s engineering team without requiring user intervention. During these disruptions, Discord recommends checking its official status page or social media channels for updates. In the meantime, affected users may attempt basic troubleshooting steps, such as restarting the application or switching devices, while awaiting full service restoration.

How many Discord users were affected? Downdetector’s figures are based on real-time, user-submitted reports, meaning the exact number of affected users could be higher or lower. However, with nearly 100,000 reports logged, the scale of the outage was significant, particularly given Discord’s role as a hub for gaming communities, online groups, and professional teams.

Both precious metals clocked solid gains after the US Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate by 25 bps and signalled the possibility of one more rate cut next year.

""Gold and silver posted solid gains after the FOMC meeting outcomes. The US Fed cuts interest rates by 25 basis points as per market expectations. The dollar index slipped to a two-month low after the FOMC meeting outcomes and supported gold and silver prices,"" Manoj Kumar Jain of Prithvifinmart Commodity Research observed.

The dollar index touched 98.30 on the downside, making gold cheaper for overseas buyers and enhancing its demand.

Meanwhile, the rupee is at its record low against the US dollar. The weakness in the domestic currency is also supporting gold prices in India.

Investors' focus is now on the US inflation and non-farm payrolls report next week, which will offer fresh cues on the Fed's monetary policy path.

Is it the right time to buy gold and silver? According to Jain, gold and silver prices may remain volatile in today’s session amid volatility in the dollar index, global financial markets and ahead of the key US economic data.

He suggests waiting for some correction before initiating fresh longs in gold and silver.

""We suggest waiting for some corrective dips for initiating fresh long positions in gold and silver, and also suggest strictly avoiding short selling in both precious metals,"" said Jain.

Jain said gold has support at $4,264 and $4,220, while resistance is at $4,355 and $4,400 per troy ounce, and silver has support at $63.50 and $62.40, while resistance is at $65 and $67.40 per troy ounce in today’s session.

MCX gold has support at ₹1,31,660 and ₹1,31,000 and resistance at ₹1,33,300 and ₹1,34,000, while silver has support at ₹1,96,600 and ₹1,94,400 and resistance at ₹2,00,000 and ₹2,04,000, said Jain.

Jigar Trivedi, Senior Research Analyst at Reliance Securities, believes one can buy silver after about a 10% correction.

""It is better to wait for a 7–10% correction before entering silver—either through ETFs or futures—for investment purposes,"" said Trivedi.

Trivedi believes MCX gold February futures may rise to ₹1,33,000 per 10 grams.

Rahul Kalantri, VP of commodities at Mehta Equities, said gold has support at $4,230 and $4,185 while resistance is at $4,310 and $4,345. Silver has support at $63 and $62.35, while resistance is at $64.40 and $64.95.

In INR, Kalantri said gold has support at ₹1,31,450 and ₹1,30,550, while resistance is at ₹1,33,150 and ₹1,34,900. Silver has support at ₹196,950 and ₹1,95,200, while resistance is at ₹2,00,550 and ₹2,01,700.

The Fed decided to cut the interest rate down to the range of 3.50% to 3.75%, marking the 25 basis point rate cut on 10 December 2025, amid the elevated inflation level in the US economy and a weakening job market.

“In support of its goals and in light of the shift in the balance of risks, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 3-1/2 to 3‑3/4 per cent,” said the FOMC in its official statement on Wednesday.

US Fed's December rate cut marks the third consecutive rate cut starting from September 2025. The central bank kept its key interest rates unchanged since December 2024 before cutting it for the first time in September this year.

The US Fed's December policy outcome comes amid the conflicting trends in the US economy. The central bank is focused on creating a balance between its dual mandate of stabilising prices while catering to the country's labour market.

Although the Fed's committee cut the interest rate in October 2025, the panel also highlighted that it will keep assessing the incoming economic data to gauge the economic outlook for the country and to understand the interest rate trajectory.

Data collected from the US Bureau of Labor's November release shows that the unemployment rate in the US hit 4.4% in September 2025, while the country added 119,000 jobs despite the federal government shutdown during the time.

What happened in US Fed's October policy meet?

On 29 October 2025, the US Federal Reserve decided to cut the key interest rate for the economy by 25 basis points to the range of 3.75% to 4.00%, for the second time in the calendar year, amid the elevated inflation levels and the US government shutdown.

The US Fed Chairman Jerome Powell also highlighted that the inflation in the US economy has picked up due to the rise in goods prices in the country. Powell attributed this rise in prices to the tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on the import of foreign goods.

On the December rate cut front, Powell said that the central bank cutting its key interest rates is not a ‘foregone conclusion’. However, this time the markets are already pricing in a rate cut on 10 December 2025.

“A further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion, far from it,” Powell said in his media address in October.

All eyes are now on the US Fed's FOMC and Chairman Jerome Powell, as the central bank will announce its policy outcome later today.

The stock jumped as much as 18.4% to its day's high of ₹4,500. The stock rebounded after hitting its 52-week low of ₹3,713.75 in early deals today. It ended 14.10% higher at ₹4,335.50.

In the last 4 sessions, the scrip has crashed almost 30%. It is still down 49% from its 52-week high of ₹7,824.95, hit in January 2025. The stock has fallen 38% in last 1 year, 31% in past 6 months, 45% in last 3 months and 27% in last 1 month.

The exchange also sought clarification from Kaynes on December 8 regarding a Moneycontrol report titled “Kaynes Tech to change auditor as it admits to reporting lapse, clarifies goodwill and receivables.”

The firm clarified, ""..recent news item which appeared in the “Website-www.moneycontrol.com” dated December 08, 2025 captioned “Kaynes Tech to change auditor as it admits to reporting lapse, clarifies goodwill and receivables”.

Brokerages split, but multibagger hopes alive Macquarie said Kaynes must demonstrate stronger cash flow, organic growth, recognition of cash subsidies, and a change of auditors to rebuild trust. It maintained its “outperform” rating with a target price of ₹7,700, implying an upside of around 100% from Monday’s close.

Macquarie noted that management acknowledged disclosure lapses in an analyst call but denied wrongdoing. The brokerage said “the management clarification sounded reasonable, but doubts have been raised on so many aspects that the water has been muddied, requiring visible improvements in internal systems before confidence fully returns.”

It added that Kaynes has corrected its earlier notes, identified the root cause of the issue, and begun implementing automated related-party checks.

JPMorgan, which last week told investors not to “fish for the dip,” released a fresh note highlighting that Kaynes is now the cheapest stock under its coverage, with a PEG ratio of 0.7x. The brokerage retained its ‘overweight’ rating and set a ₹7,550 target, also indicating nearly 100% potential upside.

However, JPMorgan flagged stretched working capital and receivables, while emphasising that “there is no change in Kaynes Tech’s fundamentals, but the recent correction has materially improved its valuation appeal, making it one of the most attractive opportunities in the sector.”

What Kotak alleged — and how the company responded Kotak Institutional Equities said it found multiple mismatches across disclosures from Kaynes Technology, Kaynes Electronics Manufacturing, and Iskraemeco for FY2025. These discrepancies, Kotak wrote, raised concerns over balance sheet representation and cash flow clarity.

Kotak pointed to the Iskraemeco and Sensonic acquisitions, noting that while ₹114 crore of goodwill was recognised, the FY25 balance sheet showed no matching increase—only a small negative adjustment and higher general reserves. It also highlighted inconsistencies between purchases, payables, and receivables across the group entities.

In its clarification, Kaynes explained that under Ind AS 103, customer contracts acquired through Iskraemeco were recognised as intangible assets, amortised over the contract period, and offset against goodwill, which is why goodwill did not rise materially in FY25.

On related-party issues, Kaynes admitted that while these transactions were correctly eliminated in consolidated accounts, they were inadvertently omitted from standalone filings—an error now corrected.

The company also responded to concerns about borrowing costs, stating that when bill discounting is included, its true average borrowing cost is around 10%, not the 17.7% implied in certain interpretations.

Reaffirming its stance on transparency, the company said, “we respect independent market research, but it is our responsibility to provide accurate information so investors can evaluate the company with confidence.”

Kaynes Technology: Technical View Kkunal V. Parar, Vice-President of Technical Research and Algo, Choice Broking said, ""On the daily chart, the stock has been persistently moving in a downtrend and is currently trading below its 200-day Moving Average, indicating continued weakness in the counter.

However, the stock is approaching a strong support zone near its previous bottom at 3850. If it manages to sustain above this level, a potential bounce-back move cannot be ruled out.

The daily momentum indicator RSI is also in the extreme oversold zone, further suggesting the possibility of a near-term rebound.

Based on the overall technical structure, we expect a recovery towards 4400 if the stock sustains above 3850 for a couple of days.

On the downside, if the stock closes below 3750 for a few sessions, it may extend its decline towards 3240.""",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/kaynes-share-price-recovers-after-a-30-crash-brokerages-still-call-it-a-potential-multibagger-11765253792020.html,2025-12-09 10:03:57+05:30,"Kaynes Technology share price: Kaynes Technology share price recovered on Tuesday, December 9 after 4 straight sessions of losses.

Recognised with the Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Shakti Puraskar 2019, Water Hero Award, and top spot in the 2023 International Young Eco-Hero Awards, she has earned praise from Prime Minister Narendra Modi who called her his “young friend” and local officials, as her efforts align with Uttar Pradesh’s massive afforestation campaigns like planting 30 crore saplings (stakeholders, latest developments).​​

From Cartoon Spark to Green Revolution

Eiha Dixit’s extraordinary journey began at just four years old, sparked by watching cartoons that highlighted nature’s beauty and the harm caused by its destruction. One day in Meerut, she spotted a barren patch in a local park and decided to plant her first lemon sapling right there, nurturing it with care alongside her family.

This simple act snowballed into weekly tree-planting drives every Sunday, drawing in volunteers, schoolchildren, and community members who now join her under the banner of the Green Eiha Smile Foundation, which she founded to amplify her vision.

Her home serves as a bustling “plant bank,” where people donate saplings that she distributes for free, ensuring no green initiative stalls due to lack of resources. Eiha’s methods stand out for their ingenuity: she and her team craft seed balls seeds encased in nutrient-rich clay to scatter in hard-to-reach areas, creating mini forests without excessive watering.

They also repurpose discarded plastic bottles into sturdy plant holders, promoting a zero-waste approach that ties environmental care with everyday sustainability. “Planting trees is the only way to do it the more, the better. I want to plant trees all my life,” Eiha declared in a heartfelt interview, her words carrying the weight of a conviction far beyond her years.

Local district officials have personally verified her plantation sites, documenting thousands of thriving trees, which paved the way for her national spotlight. Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself acknowledged her after her 2019 award, affectionately referring to her as his “young friend,” a nod that underscores how her grassroots efforts resonate at the highest levels of governance.​​

Roots Deepening, Branches Spreading Wide

Eiha’s impact truly took root in 2018 when she led a massive drive planting 1,008 saplings in a single day, a feat that caught the attention of environmental groups and propelled her foundation forward. This came at a critical time for Uttar Pradesh, where scorching heatwaves and urban expansion had stripped away vast green covers, prompting state-wide targets like the ambitious 30 crore sapling plantation campaign.

Building on this momentum, by 2023, Eiha had transformed 275 Sundays of dedication into 20 mini forests dotting Meerut and nearby areas, alongside 25 medicinal gardens in schools that teach children about native plants’ healing powers and conservation needs all without relying on external funding.

Her green clubs, now active in multiple institutions, engage hundreds of young participants in hands-on activities, from sapling care to awareness workshops, fostering a generation attuned to ecological harmony. Innovations like her pot-planting technique, which saves up to 80% water compared to traditional methods, make her model replicable even in water-scarce regions.

Recognition has poured in: beyond the Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Shakti Puraskar India’s highest civilian honour for children she clinched first place in the International Young Eco-Hero Awards in 2023, keynoted at the UN World Peace Summit, and became a brand ambassador for initiatives like Mission100CroreTree.

These accolades not only validate her work but also draw more partners, including NGOs and nurseries, expanding her reach. Officials from the district forest department have lauded her as a “beacon for community-driven afforestation,” noting how her efforts complement government drives by mobilising youth and locals in ways policies alone cannot.

Today, her story stands as a testament to how one child’s resolve can weave through challenges like pandemics and climate crises, creating lasting green legacies that benefit wildlife, air quality, and community well-being.​​

https://thelogicalindian.com/sushila-karki-becomes-nepals-first-woman-pm-as-nation-creates-history-elects-leader-through-discord/,"19-Minute Viral Video Triggers Outrage in India, Highlights Voyeurism and Gendered Blame","A 19-minute video, allegedly showing a young Indian couple in an intimate moment, went viral on social media a few weeks ago. Links were shared discreetly and not-so-discreetly, keywords trended and the clip travelled faster than any verified information about it ever did.

Even today, there is no clarity about the video’s origin, whether it was recorded consensually for private use, uploaded intentionally, leaked without consent or even manipulated using AI or deepfake technology. Yet, despite this uncertainty, public opinion arrived swiftly and decisively.

The keyword “19-minute video” quickly became one of the most searched terms on Google, soon making its way into news headlines and trending for weeks.

This pattern is not new. In India, leaked videos, often loosely labelled as ‘MMS scandals,’ have repeatedly exposed not just individuals, but a deeper societal instinct: to consume private content while outsourcing guilt, especially onto women.

Online Reactions

In the absence of verification, speculation filled the gap. Some claimed the video was a publicity stunt, others insisted it was a case of betrayal or moral failure. A few even suggested the woman ‘should have known better’.

Notably, there were also voices, particularly on platforms like Reddit, that pushed back against this narrative. Several users condemned the sharing of the video, questioned its authenticity, and criticised the disproportionate blame directed at the woman. Some even shifted focus to the man’s role, challenging the usual gendered script. These responses, while encouraging, were still drowned out by a much louder culture of voyeurism.

Selective Outrage

Past incidents, from college MMS cases in the early 2000s to more recent leaks involving private individuals, show a consistent trend. Women are subjected to harsher judgment, their character dissected and their futures compromised.

Men, even when equally involved, are more likely to fade into anonymity or be forgiven as having made a ‘mistake’.

In a recent case from West Bengal’s South 24 Parganas district, a Class 10 student allegedly died by suicide after AI-generated nude images created using her photographs were circulated on social media.

In Banda district of Uttar Pradesh, a 24-year-old woman allegedly died by suicide after an intimate video, allegedly shared by her cousin, went viral on social media. The incident reportedly led to her engagement being called off and police have registered a case against the accused.

Porn-Driven Voyeurism

In cases where videos may even be morphed or AI-generated, this consumption risks harming people who may not be involved at all.

Media researchers have long noted that sustained exposure to explicit content online has contributed to a gradual desensitisation around intimacy and consent. When sexual acts are routinely consumed as content, the boundary between private and public intimacy begins to blur.

In such an environment, the act of watching is rarely seen as participation in harm, even when the individuals involved never consented to being viewed. The persistence of this behaviour suggests that the issue is not technology alone, but the attitudes governing its use. Privacy is treated as conditional, dignity as negotiable.

Bollywood and the Male Gaze

Bollywood has, at times, treated secretly recorded intimate moments as plot devices, humour or spectacle, normalising the idea that private intimacy can be watched, replayed, and discussed.

Films such as Vicky Aur Vidya Ka Woh Wala Video, which centre their narrative around a leaked private recording, reflect how easily violations of privacy are framed as entertainment. When pop culture treats the recording and circulation of intimate moments as plot devices rather than harm, it becomes easier for audiences to see leaked videos not as abuse, but as content.

Besides, film industries across the world have long contributed to the over-sexualisation of women, often framing the female body as something to be watched, pursued, and consumed, while male desire is normalised as curiosity or conquest.

This gaze does not remain confined to the screen. When films repeatedly present women as objects of spectacle and reward aggressive masculinity, they shape how intimacy is viewed in real life.

What the law says

India does have legal provisions to address such violations. Sections of the Information Technology Act, along with provisions under the Indian Penal Code, criminalise the non-consensual sharing of intimate images and videos.

Victims can file a complaint with the police or report the case online via the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal (cybercrime.gov.in).

Under the IT Act, sharing private images without consent is punishable (Sections 66E, 67 and 67A), with penalties ranging from 3 to 7 years of imprisonment and fines.

The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita also criminalises voyeurism.

Women and children can report anonymously on the cybercrime portal .

. The law protects victims’ identity, and compensation may be sought through victim compensation schemes.

The Logical Indian’s perspective

When private moments are turned into public spectacle, the real failure lies not in intimacy, but in how casually dignity is discarded online. A society that consumes leaked content while condemning those involved must confront its own complicity. Respect for consent, privacy and accountability cannot be optional in the digital age.",https://thelogicalindian.com/19-minute-viral-video-triggers-outrage-in-india-highlights-voyeurism-and-gendered-blame/,2025-12-15 17:09:05+05:30,"A 19-minute video, allegedly showing a young Indian couple in an intimate moment, went viral on social media a few weeks ago.

Your safety matters. Sit back comfortably,” shared virally on Instagram by Little Bengaluru Stories, amassing over 3.7 lakh views by mid-December 2025.

The passenger voiced her emotional relief in the clip, netizens celebrated it as a “Peak Bengalore moment” lauding the city’s empathetic spirit, and widespread calls emerged for transport apps and authorities to encourage such gestures amid ongoing women’s safety concerns, though no official statements from Bengaluru police or Rapido have been reported as of December 15.​

Viral Note Sparks Safety Conversation

In a city where late-night travel often carries an undercurrent of unease for women, this simple handwritten message displayed prominently behind the driver’s seat in both English and Kannada transformed a routine ride into a viral symbol of reassurance.



This incident highlights a rare yet powerful display of proactive empathy from an auto driver, whose brief note acknowledges shared humanity “I’m a father and brother too” while urging passengers to relax.

Netizens and Media Fuel Empathy Wave

Social media responses poured in, blending warmth, relief, and advocacy, amplifying the clip’s impact far beyond its initial 3.7 lakh views. One commenter affirmed, “I know this city from last 20 years! It is the safest city for everyone,” while another urged, “This is what we want, and exactly what we should do,” reflecting Bengaluru’s dual image as both chaotic and kind-hearted.

Women travellers connected personally, with reactions like “As a woman who travels alone often, this honestly made me emotional” and “This is such a small thing but it makes a huge difference, especially at night,” underscoring the note’s role in rebuilding trust eroded by past safety incidents.​



Additional posts on Instagram and Facebook from accounts like I Love BNGN further propelled the narrative, with users calling for replication: “Respect to this auto driver, this is how trust is built” and “Bengaluru really has these moments that restore your faith”.

No follow-up incidents or driver interviews surfaced in updates through December 15, and neither Rapido nor Bengaluru transport officials issued statements, leaving the story as a grassroots call for systemic change in ride safety protocols.​

The Logical Indian’s Perspective

This Bengaluru auto driver’s note stands as a quiet yet potent reminder that true safety begins with empathy bridging divides through personal accountability in a society still grappling with gender-based vulnerabilities during night travel.

At The Logical Indian, we champion such acts of kindness that promote dialogue, harmony, and coexistence, inspiring drivers, ride-hailing platforms, and communities to adopt similar measures like mandatory safety messaging or awareness campaigns to foster widespread trust.

In a shocking incident from Nana Varmora village in Bhuj taluka of Gujarat’s Kutch district, police have arrested 18-year-old Mohsin Maman for allegedly killing his wife and dumping her body in a well.

According to officials, the accused was involved in an extramarital relationship and wanted to marry another woman, which allegedly led to the crime. The case surfaced after villagers reported the woman missing and raised suspicions about the circumstances surrounding her disappearance.

Following a search operation, the body was recovered, and police registered a murder case. The accused is currently in custody as investigators examine evidence, question witnesses, and probe whether others were involved.

Young Marriage, Brutal Allegations

The alleged murder of a young woman by her husband has sent shockwaves through Nana Varmora village, a quiet rural settlement in Bhuj taluka. Police identified the accused as Mohsin Maman, aged 18, who had been married for a short period.

Officials said the victim’s body was found in a well after locals alerted authorities about her sudden disappearance.

A senior police officer involved in the investigation said, “Initial findings indicate that the accused had an extramarital relationship and wanted to marry another woman.

This appears to be the primary motive behind the crime.” The official added that material evidence and witness testimonies helped establish a preliminary case against the accused, leading to his arrest.

Residents of the village expressed disbelief that such violence could occur within a young marriage. “They were very young. No one imagined something like this would happen,” said a local villager, reflecting the collective shock and grief felt by the community.

How the Crime Came to Light

The case came to light when the victim’s family reported her missing after being unable to contact her for several hours. Villagers, too, noticed unusual behaviour and raised concerns, prompting a police search. During the operation, officers recovered the woman’s body from a nearby well, confirming fears of foul play.

Police said forensic teams were immediately called to the spot, and the area was cordoned off for investigation. “We are collecting all possible evidence, including forensic reports, call detail records, and statements of people who last interacted with the couple,” an investigating officer stated.

The accused was taken into custody and later produced before a court, which granted police remand for further questioning.

Authorities have assured that the investigation is being conducted thoroughly and sensitively, keeping in mind the seriousness of the allegations and the trauma faced by the victim’s family.

Motive and Ongoing Investigation

According to police, the accused allegedly confessed during preliminary questioning, though officials stressed that the investigation is still at an early stage. “We are verifying every aspect of the case. At this point, the extramarital relationship and the desire to remarry appear to be central to the motive,” the officer said.

Investigators are also exploring whether the crime was premeditated and if any other individuals had knowledge of or involvement in the act. Police are examining mobile phone data, social interactions, and financial transactions to piece together the sequence of events leading up to the alleged murder.

Meanwhile, the victim’s family has demanded strict punishment. “She deserved justice and safety, not violence,” a relative said, urging authorities to ensure a speedy and fair trial.

Larger Concerns: Early Marriage and Domestic Violence

The incident has once again drawn attention to the issues of early marriage, lack of emotional maturity, and domestic violence in certain sections of society. While the legal age of marriage for women in India is 18 and 21 for men, early marriages continue to take place, often without adequate social or emotional support systems.

Experts note that young couples may face intense pressure, limited conflict-resolution skills, and restricted access to counselling or support. In extreme cases, unresolved conflicts and harmful attitudes can escalate into violence.

While none of these factors excuse a crime, they highlight the need for stronger community awareness, education, and intervention mechanisms.

The Logical Indian’s Perspective

This heartbreaking case is a grim reminder that violence within relationships is a deep social failure, not just an individual crime. No personal desire, social pressure, or emotional conflict can ever justify taking a life.

As a society, we must confront the realities of early marriage, patriarchal control, and the normalisation of domestic abuse, while strengthening systems that promote dialogue, mental health support, and gender equality.

At The Logical Indian, we believe in empathy, accountability, and proactive social change.

Communities, families, and institutions must work together to identify warning signs early and ensure that young people have access to guidance, counselling, and safe avenues to seek help.",https://thelogicalindian.com/teen-marriage-turns-fatal-18-year-old-arrested-for-allegedly-killing-wife-dumping-body-in-gujarat-well-probe-on/,2025-12-15 15:59:43+05:30,"An 18-year-old man has been arrested in Gujarat’s Kutch district for allegedly murdering his wife and disposing of her body in a well, with police citing an extramarital relationship and intent to remarry as the motive.

How the Crime Came to Light The case came to light when the victim’s family reported her missing after being unable to contact her for several hours. Villagers, too, noticed unusual behaviour and raised concerns, prompting a police search. During the operation, officers recovered the woman’s body from a nearby well, confirming fears of foul play. Police said forensic teams were immediately called to the spot, and the area was cordoned off for investigation. “We are collecting all possible evidence, including forensic reports, call detail records, and statements of people who last interacted with the couple,” an investigating officer stated. The accused was taken into custody and later produced before a court, which granted police remand for further questioning. Authorities have assured that the investigation is being conducted thoroughly and sensitively, keeping in mind the seriousness of the allegations and the trauma faced by the victim’s family. Motive and Ongoing Investigation According to police, the accused allegedly confessed during preliminary questioning, though officials stressed that the investigation is still at an early stage. “We are verifying every aspect of the case. At this point, the extramarital relationship and the desire to remarry appear to be central to the motive,” the officer said. Investigators are also exploring whether the crime was premeditated and if any other individuals had knowledge of or involvement in the act. Police are examining mobile phone data, social interactions, and financial transactions to piece together the sequence of events leading up to the alleged murder. Meanwhile, the victim’s family has demanded strict punishment. “She deserved justice and safety, not violence,” a relative said, urging authorities to ensure a speedy and fair trial. Larger Concerns: Early Marriage and Domestic Violence The incident has once again drawn attention to the issues of early marriage, lack of emotional maturity, and domestic violence in certain sections of society. While the legal age of marriage for women in India is 18 and 21 for men, early marriages continue to take place, often without adequate social or emotional support systems. Experts note that young couples may face intense pressure, limited conflict-resolution skills, and restricted access to counselling or support. In extreme cases, unresolved conflicts and harmful attitudes can escalate into violence. While none of these factors excuse a crime, they highlight the need for stronger community awareness, education, and intervention mechanisms. The Logical Indian’s Perspective This heartbreaking case is a grim reminder that violence within relationships is a deep social failure, not just an individual crime. No personal desire, social pressure, or emotional conflict can ever justify taking a life. As a society, we must confront the realities of early marriage, patriarchal control, and the normalisation of domestic abuse, while strengthening systems that promote dialogue, mental health support, and gender equality. At The Logical Indian, we believe in empathy, accountability, and proactive social change. Communities, families, and institutions must work together to identify warning signs early and ensure that young people have access to guidance, counselling, and safe avenues to seek help.",-0.008985119047619,0.3509494047619047,neutral,"{'neg': 0.177, 'neu': 0.742, 'pos': 0.081, 'compound': -0.9982}",negative

This figure confirms the state’s position as the epicentre of India’s agrarian crisis, a situation underscored by NCRB data showing nearly one in every two farmer suicides in the country occurs in Maharashtra.

The crisis has sparked fierce parliamentary criticism, with opposition leaders alleging severe failures in the government’s relief delivery mechanisms and a large-scale deficit of empathy.

Devastating Toll Across Vulnerable Regions

The official figures reveal a crisis concentrated in the state’s most vulnerable agricultural belts. According to a report by The Times of India, the Vidarbha region, specifically the Nagpur division, recorded the highest number of deaths with a staggering 296 farmer suicides.

Following closely was the Marathwada region, which accounted for 212 cases in the same nine-month period. These statistics highlight the disproportionate impact of market volatility and climate change on farmers in these rain-fed regions, making their struggle to repay loans after a failed harvest particularly acute and often fatal.

Minister Confirms Crisis

Relief and Rehabilitation Minister Makarand Jadhav (Patil), in his written reply to the Legislative Council, confirmed the total figure of 781 suicides and attributed the causes to mounting loans, crop losses, and excessive rains.

Jadhav referenced National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) 2023 data to contextualise the crisis, noting that one in every two farmer suicides nationally occurs in Maharashtra.

The minister assured the House that the government is implementing measures such as ensuring fair prices, expanding irrigation, and operating disaster relief centres to prevent further deaths, although the effectiveness of these measures remains highly disputed.

MP Fauzia Khan Slams Relief Failures

The government’s response drew sharp criticism from the opposition, most notably from NCP-SCP MP Fauzia Khan, who addressed the Rajya Sabha on the crisis.

Khan highlighted a separate three-month period where 766 farmer suicides were reported, stating that only 676 families had received government aid while 200 were denied assistance.

She also condemned the gap between the announced ₹31,628-crore relief package for flood damage and the grim reality on the ground. Khan pointed out, according to TOI, that only ₹82 crore was ultimately deposited into the bank accounts of just over one lakh farmers, despite a much larger allocation.

Today in the Rajya Sabha, during Zero Hour, I raised urgent concerns over the severe distress facing farmers in Maharashtra after this year’s floods. Nearly 68.7 lakh hectares of crops across 29 districts were damaged, impacting close to 60 lakh farmers.



Despite a ₹31,628 crore… pic.twitter.com/z3raWFth1y — Fauzia Khan (@DrFauziaKhanNCP) December 11, 2025

Discrepancy in Disaster Reporting

MP Khan also exposed a critical discrepancy in official reporting that potentially limited central aid. She cited figures showing that while the State Agriculture Minister had previously confirmed that floods affected 14.36 lakh hectares of crop area, the official report submitted to the Centre cited a much smaller figure of only 1,10,309 hectares.

Khan called this huge difference “unfair and a joke with the farmers,” arguing that this data manipulation or error prevents the state from seeking adequate disaster relief, leaving lakhs of farmers without the financial lifeline they urgently need for survival and recovery.

The Logical Indian’s Perspective

The chronic repetition of these tragic statistics year after year confirms that Maharashtra’s agrarian crisis is a fundamental systemic failure, not merely a seasonal setback.

The minister’s assurance of ‘implemented measures’ rings hollow when juxtaposed with the alarming suicide rate and the opposition’s proof of aid being blocked or denied to hundreds of grieving families.

The alleged discrepancy in land damage reporting is particularly egregious, suggesting administrative incompetence or deliberate efforts to obscure the true scale of the disaster.",https://thelogicalindian.com/781-farmer-suicides-reported-in-maharashtra-in-nine-months-state-minister-informs-legislative-council/,2025-12-15 15:39:18+05:30,"Maharashtra recorded a tragic 781 farmer suicides in the first nine months of 2025 (January to September), with the primary drivers being debt, severe crop failure, and excessive rainfall, according to state Relief Minister Makarand Jadhav’s statement to the Legislative Council.

What began as an initiative to support school infrastructure has today evolved into a broader mission: helping children not just attend school, but truly learn and thrive.

Over the last two decades, P&G Shiksha continues to reach over 50 lakh children across India, working with grassroots partners to tackle everything from learning gaps to early childhood education. But beyond the numbers are real stories. Stories of children who’ve overcome obstacles like poverty, lack of resources, or personal loss, and discovered what’s possible when learning becomes accessible.

As P&G Shiksha marks two decades of its journey, we take a closer look at a few remarkable young lives that found wings.

Chennai

Jayamani | A Journey from a Hut to a Chartered Accountant

Jayamani’s journey began in a government school in Minjur, on the outskirts of Chennai. She joined in Grade 2 when the school was little more than a thatched hut. Today, she is a successful Chartered Accountant and the proud founder of her own firm. She credits that transformation, both personal and institutional, to the foundation she received there.

With support from P&G Shiksha and Round Table India, the school evolved over the years to include proper classrooms, toilet blocks, and a stronger faculty. “My school education played a pivotal role in helping me build my career,” Jayamani says. Thanks to dedicated teachers and an encouraging environment, she never needed extra tuition.

Having completed her B.Com and M.Com, she eventually earned her Chartered Accountancy qualification, becoming a role model for others like her. “The school now has more than 1,000 students,” she reflects. “I’m proud to be its alumna and grateful for the opportunities P&G Shiksha helped make possible.”

Delhi

Naina | Rebuilding the Bond Between a Child and Her Mother Through Education

Naina, a six-year-old student at MCD School in Mandoli, Delhi, often struggled to focus in class and frequently missed school. Her teachers noticed that something was holding her back at home, and that’s when a Community Instructor Mentor (CIM) from P&G Shiksha’s Early Childhood Education (ECE) program stepped in.

During a home visit, the CIM discovered that Naina had been adopted later in childhood, not as an infant. This made it difficult for her to adjust to her new environment and form a strong bond with her parents, especially her mother.

To support the family, the CIM invited Naina’s mother to join a group of mothers whose children were of a similar age. Through these regular meetings, and with the help of play-based activities designed by the Pratham Foundation – P&G Shiksha partner, Naina’s mother began engaging with her daughter more meaningfully, even while managing household chores.

Over time, this gentle, consistent effort helped rebuild their relationship. Naina began attending school more regularly, listening to instructions in class, and bonding better with her classmates. Her mother, now a regular participant in the group, found strength in the support of other caregivers and continued to stay involved in her daughter’s learning.

Today, Naina comes home and shares stories from school with her mother, who listens with interest, helps with homework, and continues to build their connection through simple, joyful activities. What began as emotional distance has turned into a warm, growing bond enabled through education.

Madhya Pradesh

Garima | From a Small Town to the Gates of IIT

“When passion fuels your wings, you can fly to touch the sky.” This is true for Garima Mandloi, now pursuing Civil Engineering at IIT Roorkee.

Garima always ranked among the top in her school in Satlapur, Madhya Pradesh, one of the firsts to be supported by P&G Shiksha since 2002. P&G Shiksha’s infrastructural interventions helped Garima by creating a conducive learning environment, supporting students as well as teachers with the right support so that they gained the most out of the ecosystem, fueling motivation as well as school attendance. In addition, P&G Shiksha continued to support the learning outcomes for these children like Garima, by offering additional support, such as English education, fueling their dreams.

Garima worked hard, cracked the JEE, and today stands as an inspiration for many girls. She credits the school and P&G Shiksha’s early intervention for her success, saying, “The English teaching support I received early on at the school immensely helped me improve.

Garima is set to complete her degree in 2025, emerging as a shining role model for many girls who aspire to follow in her footsteps.

How the Programme Evolved with India’s Needs

Over the years, P&G Shiksha’s approach has evolved from building school infrastructure like classrooms and toilets to addressing deeper educational needs like learning gaps. According to the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2024, more than 50% of students in grade 5 are unable to read grade 2 level text, highlighting a critical issue—the ‘learning gap’.

When a child falls behind in their learning level, it creates a gap between their current learning levels and what is expected at grade level. The gap significantly impacts children who perpetually keep trying to cope and are often labelled owing to lack of awareness regarding learning gaps. Alarmingly, only *28% adults have a complete understanding of learning gaps.

P&G Shiksha address these learning gaps via a three-pronged approach: Prevention, Remediation, and Ensuring Learning Continuity. These include initiatives like early childhood education, STEM scholarships for girls, and AI-driven learning support. In partnership with organizations like Pratham Education Foundation, Round Table India, and Educational Initiatives, the initiative continues to adapt to India’s changing educational landscape.

As India moves from focusing solely on enrolment numbers to improving learning outcomes, efforts like these show how consistent and long-term support, especially at the grassroots level, can create meaningful change.

And somewhere in that quiet shift, P&G Shiksha has been there. Believing in the power of a classroom and the dreams that start there.

The incident sparked widespread reactions and concern among viewers.

However, the video is not recent and a 7-month-old video, Central Railways clarified.

Claim

The claim circulating with the video is that this is a recent event involving a passenger in an AC coach confronting railway authorities aggressively.

Fact

Central Railway clarified on the social media platform X that the video is not recent but approximately seven months old, dating back to around April 2025. The video shows a genuine incident but is being recirculated as new, misleading viewers about its timing. Verified sources affirming this include:

Central Railway official statement on X

Reports from Free Press Journal dated April 2025 covering the original incident

Additional news coverage and clarifications by local media and official railway portals

Conclusion

This fact-check is classified as Misleading Content because while the video is authentic, presenting it as a current event without clarifying that it is about an older incident distorts the context and creates misinformation. Proper contextualization is essential to avoid misunderstanding and alarm.

Claim

The claim circulating is that Pakistan has officially included Salman Khan in its terror watchlist under the “Fourth Schedule” due to his Balochistan remarks, labeling him as an “Azad Balochistan Facilitator.”

Fact

This claim is false. The Pakistani government has denied any such action, and the circulated documents are fabricated. Pakistani authorities do not file individual names of non-threatening foreigners on terror watchlists without credible evidence and official verification.

Both India Today and Financial Express, along with Times Now, have reported that the document is most likely fake. Dr. Sandeep Seth shared a post from Pakistan’s Ministry of Information & Broadcasting that clarifies the falsehood of the claim, confirming the circulating report is unverified and false.

Stalin, was preparing to introduce a bill banning the Hindi language in all forms across the state.

Several posts claimed that the proposed bill would prohibit the use of Hindi in films, hoardings, songs, and even within the state assembly. The rumour quickly sparked outrage and confusion, reviving old debates around Tamil pride and anti-Hindi sentiments.

However, the claim is completely false. Tamil Nadu’s fact check unit clarified in a post on X.

Claim

A viral claim asserts that the Tamil Nadu government is planning to introduce legislation in the state assembly to ban the Hindi language in all forms (e.g. in films, hoardings, signage, songs, etc.).

The viral message appears to have originated from a few social media handles and blogs that cited unnamed “sources” claiming such a bill would be tabled during the ongoing Assembly session. Some media portals even published speculative headlines before verifying the information, adding fuel to the misinformation.

Fact

Amid the growing chatter, Tamil Nadu’s official fact-check unit stepped in and issued a categorical denial.

In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the @Tn_factcheck handle wrote:

“A claim is being circulated that a bill has been introduced to ban Hindi language in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly. This claim is completely false. The Secretary of the Legislative Assembly has clarified that no such proposal has been received or is under consideration.”

The clarification put the rumour to rest.

Why This Matters

Tamil Nadu has historically been vocal against the “imposition” of Hindi, a sentiment that stems from decades of linguistic and cultural assertion. That’s precisely why misinformation around the issue spreads fast, it plays on genuine emotions attached to Tamil identity and politics.

But in this case, the rumour was entirely fabricated, likely designed to provoke unnecessary linguistic tension online.

https://thelogicalindian.com/sushila-karki-becomes-nepals-first-woman-pm-as-nation-creates-history-elects-leader-through-discord/,"PM Modi Launches ‘Your Money, Your Right’ Campaign to Help Indians Reclaim ₹1 Lakh Crore in Forgotten Assets","Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Your Money, Your Right” campaign seeks to reconnect millions of Indians with over ₹1 lakh crore in forgotten financial assets, combining digital tools, grassroots outreach and regulatory coordination to strengthen financial inclusion.

Across India’s vast financial system lies a staggering pool of unclaimed money-bank deposits left dormant, insurance payouts never collected, mutual fund investments forgotten, and dividends unpaid.

To address this silent accumulation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spearheaded a nationwide awareness and facilitation drive titled “Your Money, Your Right.”

Launched on October 4, 2025, the campaign aims to empower citizens, including NRIs and legal heirs, to trace and reclaim financial assets that belong to them but have slipped through the cracks of time, migration and paperwork.

According to official estimates, unclaimed assets in India now exceed ₹1 lakh crore, with nearly ₹78,000 crore lying in banks alone. Insurance companies hold around ₹14,000 crore, mutual funds about ₹3,000 crore, and unpaid dividends account for close to ₹9,000 crore.

The government says these figures represent the hard-earned savings of ordinary families-money that could support education, healthcare or small businesses if returned to rightful owners.

A Three-Pronged National Campaign

The initiative rests on a three-pillar framework-Awareness, Accessibility and Action. At the awareness level, the Prime Minister and the Ministry of Finance have repeatedly urged citizens to “check once” for forgotten assets, stressing that even small, inactive accounts can add up to significant sums over time.

Public messages, social media outreach and multilingual information campaigns have been rolled out to reach diverse communities.

Accessibility is being addressed through a network of dedicated digital portals created by financial regulators. The Reserve Bank of India’s UDGAM portal allows users to search for unclaimed bank deposits using basic identifiers such as name, PAN or Aadhaar.

Insurance claimants can approach IRDAI’s Bima Bharosa, mutual fund investors have SEBI’s MITRA platform, while unpaid dividends and shares can be traced via the Investor Education and Protection Fund Authority (IEPFA) under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs.

The third pillar-action-comes alive through on-ground facilitation camps. So far, camps have been organised in over 470 districts, with bank officials and regulators assisting citizens in filing claims, verifying documents and understanding next steps.

Government officials report that these combined efforts have already helped return around ₹2,000 crore to rightful owners within weeks of the campaign’s launch.

Human Stories Behind the Numbers

While the figures are striking, officials emphasise that the real impact lies in individual stories. Many unclaimed assets belong to elderly account holders who changed addresses, workers who migrated across states, or families unaware of investments made decades ago.

In several cases, legal heirs remained oblivious to insurance policies or fixed deposits held by deceased relatives.

At facilitation camps, bank officers recount instances of widows discovering long-forgotten savings accounts, or adult children tracing dividends linked to shares bought by parents in the 1980s and 1990s.

For rural households, even modest recoveries can make a meaningful difference, underscoring why the government is keen to take the process beyond digital platforms alone.

Coordination Across Regulators and States

One notable feature of “Your Money, Your Right” is the coordination across institutions that traditionally operate in silos. The RBI, SEBI, IRDAI, banks, insurance firms and state-level committees are working together under a unified message.

In some states and Union Territories, including Jammu & Kashmir, mega facilitation camps have been organised at district headquarters to reach remote populations.

Officials say standardised claim procedures and simplified documentation requirements are being promoted to reduce friction.

The emphasis, they note, is not merely on reclaiming money but also on restoring trust in the financial system, especially among citizens who may feel intimidated by formal processes.

Why Unclaimed Assets Keep Growing

Despite repeated efforts over the years, India’s pool of unclaimed financial assets has continued to expand. Experts point to several reasons: frequent changes in contact details, lack of nominee updates, low financial literacy, and limited awareness of claim mechanisms.

Digitalisation has improved record-keeping, but it has also widened gaps for those without easy access to technology.

The current campaign acknowledges these challenges by blending technology with human support. By encouraging families to update nominations, maintain records and periodically review investments, the government hopes to prevent today’s active accounts from becoming tomorrow’s unclaimed assets.

A Step Towards Deeper Financial Inclusion

Beyond immediate recovery, the initiative aligns with India’s broader push for financial inclusion and consumer empowerment.

Officials argue that returning dormant funds to citizens not only boosts household resilience but also reinforces the idea that financial institutions are custodians, not owners, of public money.

The campaign has also sparked conversations about proactive disclosure by banks and companies, and the need for clearer communication with customers over the long term.

Some policy observers suggest that periodic reminders, easier nominee management and community-level financial education could reduce the scale of unclaimed assets in future.

The Logical Indian’s Perspective

The “Your Money, Your Right” campaign is a timely reminder that economic justice often begins with awareness. Helping citizens reclaim what is rightfully theirs is not just a financial exercise; it is an act of dignity, empathy and inclusion.

Yet, the sheer volume of unclaimed assets also reflects systemic gaps in financial literacy and accessibility, particularly for the elderly, migrants and digitally excluded communities.

At The Logical Indian, we believe that such initiatives must be sustained beyond campaigns-through continuous education, simplified systems and compassionate outreach-so that no one is left behind in navigating their financial rights.",https://thelogicalindian.com/pm-modi-launches-your-money-your-right-campaign-to-help-indians-reclaim-%e2%82%b91-lakh-crore-in-forgotten-assets/,2025-12-13 13:10:25+05:30,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Your Money, Your Right” campaign seeks to reconnect millions of Indians with over ₹1 lakh crore in forgotten financial assets, combining digital tools, grassroots outreach and regulatory coordination to strengthen financial inclusion.

This novel technique aims to physically slow vehicles and improve road safety for wildlife. The urgent measure follows the tragic death of a cheetah cub in a Gwalior hit-and-run incident a week prior.

Regional NHAI officials confirmed this is the first-of-its-kind road marking on an Indian highway, forming a crucial part of a larger ₹122.25 crore project to expand the 11.9 km highway stretch, which includes constructing underpasses and fencing.

Wildlife Fatalities Prompt Urgent Action

The rapid deployment of the new safety marking was a direct response to the increasing danger highways pose to India’s wildlife, highlighted by the recent death of a cheetah cub. The cub, which had strayed from Kuno National Park, was killed on the Agra–Mumbai Highway, underscoring the severe risk of high-speed traffic in animal corridors.

Madhya Pradesh, in particular, faces a significant conflict, having recorded 237 animal-vehicle collisions and 94 fatalities over the last two years. This high rate of fatal incidents on roads that traverse protected areas, like the Veerangana Durgavati Tiger Reserve, demanded an immediate and effective intervention from authorities to safeguard animals crossing the road for habitat access.

Table-Top Red Marking

The innovative measure involves applying the 5 mm thick red surface layer, the “table-top,” over the road in the designated danger zone within the tiger reserve. NHAI officials explained that the bright red colour serves as an immediate visual warning to drivers entering a wildlife zone.

Crucially, the slightly raised, textured surface forces vehicles to reduce speed automatically, mitigating collision risk. This is part of a comprehensive ₹122.25 crore project on the 11.9-kilometre section that includes the construction of approximately 25 underpasses based on animal movement patterns.

Other safety additions include white shoulder lines, chain-link fencing to block animal access, and speed detector devices to regulate driver behaviour within the sensitive habitat.

The Logical Indian’s Perspective

The NHAI’s decisive action on NH-45, integrating this innovative red marking with structural protections like underpasses and fencing, is a model of responsible, ethical infrastructure development. It proves that large-scale expansion, like turning a two-lane road into four, does not have to come at the expense of our precious wildlife.

The “table-top” method is an excellent, simple demonstration of empathy and coexistence engineered into the road itself. We commend the authorities for their rapid response following the cheetah cub’s death.

The decline erased near-term gains despite the company’s ambitious Ask Sage acquisition and strong government backlog.

The development highlighted how small-cap AI plays remain vulnerable to sector-wide profit-taking and investor concern about equity dilution and lumpy revenue trends.

The move underscores the tension between the BBAI stock growth narrative and the execution realities facing a high-burn company still dependent on external capital raises to fund operations and acquisitions.​

BBAI stock: Macro headwinds amplify small-cap weakness

Monday’s 6% decline for BigBear.ai occurred in the context of a broader AI sector rout.

The S&P 500 slipped 0.3% as investors rotated away from expensive technology names, with Broadcom and Oracle leading the retreat after disappointing guidance last week.

For a small-cap stock like BBAI, trading with a beta of 3.2, meaning it tends to move three times faster than the broader market, sector weakness translates into outsized selling pressure.​

Sentiment around AI infrastructure spending turned cautious after Broadcom signaled margin compression and OpenAI pushed back its data center capex timeline.

BigBear.ai, despite its government contracts focus, shares those macro-sector headwinds and saw traders pare positions on valuation concerns and de-risking activity.​

The broader market’s unease about stretched AI valuations has particular teeth for a company trading at price-to-sales multiples well above historical averages.

Analyst coverage remains mixed; some firms maintain “Strong Buy” ratings, citing future growth potential, while others have issued holds and cautionary notes on slowing revenue growth and execution risk.​

Dilution and lumpy revenues

Beyond the sector selloff, BigBear.ai faces investor scrutiny over its aggressive share issuance strategy.

In 2025, the company raised approximately $293 million through at-the-market (ATM) equity offerings, allowing it to build a record cash balance of $456.6 million as of September 30.

While that war chest positions the company to fund the $250 million Ask Sage acquisition and accelerate growth, the dilution raises shareholder concerns.​

In December, BigBear.ai’s board increased authorized common shares from 500 million to 1 billion, effectively doubling the company’s capacity to issue equity without another shareholder vote.

Market observers flagged this move as a signal that additional dilution is likely, particularly if the Ask Sage deal requires more funding or if government contract execution stumbles.​

Operationally, BigBear.ai reported disappointing Q3 2025 results.

Revenue fell 20% year-over-year to $33.1 million, driven by lower volumes on Army programs. Gross margins compressed to 22.4% from 25.9%.

Adjusted EBITDA turned negative at $(9.4) million versus positive $0.9 million a year earlier.

The company reaffirmed its full-year 2025 revenue outlook of $125–$140 million, but the quarterly miss and margin deterioration spooked investors.​

The one bright spot: backlog expanded to $376 million as of September 30, suggesting future revenue potential if the company can convert government bookings into actual orders.​

The index edged down roughly 0.3% in midday trading, while the Dow fell about 145 points and the Nasdaq slipped 0.5%.

The pullback extends the technology sector’s struggles from last week, when Broadcom’s disappointing guidance and Oracle’s clouded outlook sparked a rotation away from AI-linked equities.​

US stocks turn red: AI casualties drag on equities

After an early rally that pushed futures higher by 0.4% at the open, investors rotated back into caution as the week’s first trading session unfolded.

Breadth deteriorated throughout the morning, with decliners outpacing advancers as technology shares bore the brunt of selling pressure.

The semiconductor sector, which has benefited most from AI infrastructure buildouts, proved particularly vulnerable.

Broadcom slipped lower despite Friday’s devastating 11% selloff, while Oracle struggled to recover from its two-day rout that erased roughly 16% from the stock’s value.​

Trading volumes remained elevated, a sign that both institutional and retail holders were rebalancing positions after last week’s rapid repricing of AI risk.

The VIX held steady near 16, reflecting elevated but not panic-level anxiety about near-term market direction. ​

The intraday move represents a continuation of last week’s theme: investors are questioning whether the explosive rally in AI infrastructure stocks was warranted given execution risks, capital intensity, and uncertain near-term returns on spending.​

Why AI sellers are in control

Broadcom’s collapse planted the seeds for Monday’s weakness.

CEO Hock Tan’s guidance that custom AI chip revenue would rise substantially but warned of margin compression due to upfront manufacturing costs spooked investors still nursing losses from the tech selloff.

The company’s $73 billion AI backlog, while impressive, may not be enough to offset concerns that profitability will lag behind the magnitude of revenue growth.​

Oracle’s situation proved more dire. The company’s stock has tumbled by more than 40% from its September peak after disappointing investors with both earnings and forward guidance.

A Bloomberg report, later disputed by Oracle, suggested OpenAI data center buildout delays until 2028 sent shockwaves through the hyperscaler supply chain trade.

Nvidia, AMD, and other semiconductor peers all faced selling pressure as investors demanded proof that AI spending would deliver tangible returns rather than simply inflating capex budgets.​

Analysts pointed to stretched valuations as a primary culprit.

Companies like Palantir command price-to-earnings multiples exceeding 400, while AMD and Broadcom trade north of 100 times earnings, far above the S&P 500’s historical average of 18.

That leaves little room for disappointment.​

The week ahead carries significant risk potential. Critical inflation data arrives Thursday alongside Fed commentary, while delayed labor reports hit Tuesday.

Investors remain vigilant for any signal that the Federal Reserve might recalibrate its rate-cutting plans, which would further compress multiples for already-expensive growth stocks.
